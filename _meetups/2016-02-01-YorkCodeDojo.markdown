York Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming. We focus on practical coding sessions , where you can learn by doing.

Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then York Code Dojo is for you!

All languages and levels of experience welcome.
