I'll explore how we got to this point, and introduce some modern tools for infrastructure as code.</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/6/9/600_466165961.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Jon Topper</b></p> <p>Jon Topper has been doing DevOps since before we called it that. His UK-based consultancy, The Scale Factory, are a team of DevOps and cloud infrastructure specialists, helping organisations of various sizes design, build, operate and scale their infrastructure.
