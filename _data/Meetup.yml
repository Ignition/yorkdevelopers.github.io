  description: "<p><b>What's happening?</b></p> <p>Are you an artist, maker, hobbyist, tinkerer, engineer or someone who just likes to make things or even just discuss creativity in Leeds?</p> <p>Come along and talk to like minded people and members at Leeds Hackspace, feel free to bring along a project that you're working on or just have a chat.</p> <p><b>So is this free? Do I have to book or something?</b></p> <p>Yes, it is free. Leeds Hackspace is a work-space, community group type and workshop area. We have snacks you can buy at our own Tuck Shop, internet access via WiFi or wired Ethernet.</p> <p><b>There doesn't seem to be many attending?</b></p> <p>A lot of our members, some 30+ do not use Meetup, and they regularly attend the open evenings/days without RSVPing on here. So don't worry, the open evenings happen regularly and every week.</p> <p><b>What do you have?</b></p> <p>Wood and metal workshop, laser cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl cutter, computers, electronics, a heat press, and all sorts of <a href=\"https://wiki.leedshackspace.org.uk/wiki/Leeds_Hackspace\">other goodies</a>. However, using a lot of these things require an induction and for you to be a paying member, but we have these open evenings so that you can look around and check the place out. Some members are happy to help you if you need to be pointed in the right direction or have something that needs repairs.</p> <p><b>So is this a business.. ?</b></p> <p>Leeds Hackspace is registered as a business, but it is run voluntarily by Directors and members, if you want to see a change you can make it happen.</p> <p><b>How do I get there?</b></p> <p>You can find out more details about visiting here: <a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\"><a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/</a></a> there is limited on-site free parking, and on-street parking is free after 6pm.</p> <p><b>What if I want to ask more questions?</b></p> <p>We also have a mailing list: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space</a></p> "

Is there a middle-ground that incorporates both without compromising and resulting in limitations?</i></p> <p><i>This talk will focus on database abstraction, query latency &amp; domain model and persistence mapping patterns in PHP applications. It will introduce the core concepts behind “Agile Data” - (database abstraction library available under MIT from <a href=\"http://github.com/atk4/data\">github.com/atk4/data</a>).</i></p> <p>Romans is an author of “Agile Data” and an active PHP / SaaS developer since 1997.</p> <p>Romans Malinovskis on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/romaninsh\">@romaninsh</a></p> <p><b>Building a REPL for Phunkie, with Phunkie</b> – Marcello Duarte</p> <p><br/><i>After writing PhpSpec using PhpSpec, I decided my latest project should be writing a REPL for Phunkie – my PHP functional structures library – using Phunkie itself, along with functional programming patterns and techniques.</p> <p>This talk will share my learnings. We’ll go through the code, understand the design, and learn how to apply some of the Functional Programming (FP) principles in a real-life scenario. We’ll go beyond the basics and look at how FP deals with state, composition, and side-effects like IO, validation, and more.</p> <p>We’ll also discuss the benefits and costs of the functional approach. You will leave this session with an appetite to learn even more about what FP, and in particular FP in PHP with Phunkie, has to offer.</i></p> <p>Marcello is a co-creator of PhpSpec and the Head of Training at Inviqa</p> <p>Marcello Duarte on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_md\">@_md</a></p> <p><b>Sponsors</b></p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support of this community event.</p> <p><a href=\"http://futurelabs.org.uk/\">Futurelabs</a></p> <p> – Are a not-for-profit formed to help provide a focal point for tech start-up and scale-up businesses in and around Leeds.

I networked with like-minded IT Directors and Heads of IT, sharing some useful tools, practices and insights which I have transferred to the workplace. It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> '
