- name: LeedsDevops - January 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>Happy new year, we've our first meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Thursday 24th January 2019:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 7:55 : Site Reliability Engineering: If it works for Google...<br/>8:55 - 8:10 : Intermission<br/>8:10 - 9:00 : The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>Our first talk is from Sam Smith who is a Reliability Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming, his interests include graphs, data stores and not having to turn things off and on again at 02:00 whilst on call.</p> <p>The talk is entitled \"Site Reliability Engineering: If it works for Google...\"</p> <p>...It might not work so well for you. That is, unless you adapt it. Sam will give a brief overview of what reliability engineering is and how it is different from \"DevOps\" along with some of the main pillars of SRE pactices. Next he will jump into a ongoing story of attempting to implement these practices at a non global scale.</p> <p>This will touch on monitoring practices, incident response and post mortems and their place in the Service Reliability Hierarchy. He will relate this paper exercise to reality, what tools do we use and why? Which of these have worked well and which haven't. Expect a story or two of unfortunate DevOps accidents and how they could have been avoided with different practices and mindsets.</p> <p>Finally he will talk about how you can start to organise for cultural change from your own team to get cross business buy in and change working practices for the better in your own work place.</p> <p>Our second talk is from Mihaela Drumeva (Micky for short), ahead of her appearence at Config Management Camp she brings us a preview of her talk \"The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey\". Micky has a passion to automate all things. If she needs to perform a task more than twice, she'll automate it. Currently an operations engineer at Solarwinds, her 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams, from development to test, build and infrastructure.</p> <p>Micky will cover..</p> <p>- What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background?<br/>- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?<br/>- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?</p> <p>Having started her first job as an operations engineer roughly 18 months ago, she had all of those questions and many more. Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey. She'd like to share the lessons she learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>As it's the start of a new year we've decided to expand the range of refreshments we offer, there will now be a wider range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

  description: "<p>**HTTP API patterns**</p> <p>I GET how to DELETE but the real question is \"To PUT or to POST?\" or is it PATCH? What there's more?!</p> <p>After doing the standard HTTP CRUD, sometimes you need to do more, become a little more sophisticated in your manipulation of resources and add some depth to your HTTP API.</p> <p>This talk will take you through some common HTTP API patterns, provide you with names for these patterns so we can talk about them, describe what the patterns are and when they are generally used, and go through working examples.</p> <p>Hopefully, this information will help people create richer HTTP APIs, make you REST easy and everything 200 OK.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Toby Henderson is an Application Architect at Huddle, the #1 SharePoint alternative for enterprise content collaboration. He has over 20 years experience of commercial software engineering and has given talks at DDD events.</p> "
