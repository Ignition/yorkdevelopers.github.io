Doug's focus over the last few years has been the network performance - fast delivery of content.</p> <p>Here's a little about the talk:</p> <p>Over 90% of mobile apps utilize network connections to download content. However, many apps have not fully optimized the transfer, causing delays and frustrating customers. In this talk, we'll look at how to profile the network transfers made in your mobile app or website, and walk through a number of best practices to identify and resolve. After this talk, you will know how to test for network inefficiencies, identify some common issues, and be able to resolve them in your code.</p> <p>Schedule</p> <p>6.00 - Meet, get drinks<br/>6.10 - \"It's Time To Stop Stalling: Mobile App and Video Performance\" by Douglas Dollars<br/>7.00 - Fin</p> "

This can lead to feelings of personal doubt (e.g. imposter syndrome) and mental fatigue. The suspiring truth is that these feelings of doubt are a natural response to 21st century life. This is because your brain is designed to survive and not flourish. This session will show how your brain is designed to work, why we sometimes doubt ourselves and beat ourselves up, and how we all can begin to build resilience.</p> <p>1. The dominant survival brain – the limbic regions<br/>2. Why dwelling on unhelpful thoughts can become an unhelpful habit<br/>3. The important role of the pre-frontal cortex in being resilient</p> <p>Dr. Jon Finn is the founder and Managing Director of Tougher Minds; passionate about making complex science simple, so that people can use these insights to be their best and help others to be at their best.</p> <p>Much of his current work is helping individuals, teams and managers in London, and the USA, to harness individual and team success in the challenging modern work and societal context. This work includes supporting developers working for banks, investment managers and high-growth start ups to be at their best.</p> <p>Jon has been working in the field of performance psychology and behaviour change for over 17 years. He completed his PhD at Leeds Beckett University investigating the role of emotional regulation in the challenging transitions of some of Britain’s most high-performing athletes. He has worked extensively in elite sport, particularly in professional football, rugby, cricket and golf.</p> <p>www.tougherminds.co.uk</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform <a href=\"https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform\" class=\"linkified\">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform</a> – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.

- name: Software Craftsmanship and Agile & Let's invent a team game!
  description: "<p>Let's invent a team game!</p> <p>Last year @AgileManc we explored the Real Roles team game. This went down so well that we decided to build a new game together. We have built the basic framework for a new card game. We have templates to speed things up and our printer is ready to create a professionally presented card deck. The rest is up to you...</p> <p>Using an iterative approach in this session, you will create, test and refine a new team game. Its aim will be to help teams to continuously improve. It also needs to have useful instructions and informative packaging. The end product will be a shiny new deck of cards designed by you, which we will send to everyone involved for free - fresh off the production line. Delegates can also opt in to be credited as co-creator in the online instructions.</p> <p>About Laurence Wood</p> <p>Creator of the Real Roles Agile team game, Laurence inspires teams to deliver more value, more often, using agile and lean in the UK and India. He discovered lean as a Jaguar Cars apprentice in 1988 supervising V12 XJS assembly and studying manufacturing engineering at The University of Birmingham. Ford’s takeover prompted his decision to move fully into IT with RAD (Rapid Application Development) agile pioneers Marks and Spencer in London. Freelance development lead roles followed in South Africa, Austria and the UK, including at Coca Cola and South African Airways. He later became a development manager then divisional head of IT in the demanding City of London investment banking arena. Now Yorkshire-based, he likes to inspire agile leaders to deliver more value more often.</p> "
