  description: "<p>Join us to hear from Ash Winter and Rael Sasiak-Rushby, as well as a chance to win a code for a year subscription for a Jetbrains toolbox product of your choice!</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30 - 6:45: People start arriving<br/>6:45 - 6:50: Introductions<br/>6:50 - 7:20: Ash Winter - A Testers Guide to the Illusions of Unit Testing<br/>7:20 - 7:35: Break with food and chat<br/>7:35 - 8:20: Rael Sasiak-Rushby - I can write my Webscript with no alphachars<br/>8:20 - 9:00: Social &amp; point that people can leave</p> <p>Talks:<br/>Ash Winter - A Testers Guide to the Illusions of Unit Testing<br/>\"One area that testers might be able to enhance their contributions to software development teams is how we perceive and contribute to unit testing. Being able to influence this type of testing in a positive manner is a skill that testers will need to get to grips with, as more companies start to embrace a model of lone testers in cross functional teams. The shift of focus from primarily the testing that testers do, to the testing that the team does, is a key shift in thinking and behaviour.</p> <p>To facilitate this shift, I believe testers busting their own illusions about this aspect of building something good would bring us much closer to developers, and help us realise what other layers of testing can cover most effectively. The last point is pertinent here, as knowing and guiding unit testing brings the role of integration, acceptance and exploratory testing into sharp focus.</p> <p>This is a topic that has always intruiged me, having predominantly worked as a single tester on a team for the last five or so years. I reached out to the community with the question \"What do testers believe about unit testing?\" and received a lot of engagement. The good users of Twitter added another 50 or so illusions that testers might have about this layer of testing. I figured that based on that level of engagement, maybe this would make an interesting talk! It wasn't only testers who responded too, suggesting that there might be some shared illusions about unit testing that are cross discplinary.</p> <p>The growing list intruiged me, so I wrote a blog with the raw list, it can be found here <a href=\"http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/testers-guide-to-myths-of-unit-testing.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/testers-guide-to-myths-of-unit-testing.html</a></p> <p>The list alone is interesting but now I would like to share my analysis of it with you, focusing on:</p> <p>- Recurring themes within the list and how to address them as a tester or developer.<br/>- Particular illusions to look out for with examples from my recent past.<br/>- A guide for developers to engage with testers on unit testing, and testers with developers.\"</p> <p>Rael Sasiak-Rushby - I can write my Webscript with no alphachars<br/>\"It's about some of the crazy things about JavaScript \"under the hood\" learnt through filter evasion, explaining how I can write filly compliant and legit JavaScript that doesn't use any of the letters a-z.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: APIs on the Scale of Decades with Gary Fleming
  description: "<p>\"APIs are hard. They are pretty much ship now, regret later.\" -- Chet Haase.</p> <p>What do Greek philosophy, early video games, and Japanese bullet trains tell us about how we should design our APIs?</p> <p>Writing any old API is easy. Writing an API that can evolve to meet your needs over the coming months, years, and even decades; now that's hard. We'll look at some common practices and try to see where they go wrong, some misunderstood techniques and how to use them better, and some less common practices that might be useful.</p> <p>Let me give you some good advice that'll help you evolve your APIs, and some big ideas that might provoke some interesting thoughts.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Gary is an agile provocateur, software nomad, and lean mercenary. His main hobby is to try and help companies to build better software in better ways. Sometimes this is by helping them with the messy human communication side of agile, and sometimes it's through teaching better software crafting practices - but it's usually at least some of each. Coaching, mentoring, writing, and showing; whatever helps in the context. You'll find him at various local meetups trying to both share what he knows and learn from his peers.</p> "
