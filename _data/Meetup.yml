- name: ACCU York [July 2019] - Developing Elasticsearch
  description: "<p>If you've ever searched Wikipedia, bought something on eBay, caught an Uber, or flown out of Stansted Airport you've used a system called Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is a versatile open-source distributed search engine with a decade of history, thousands of contributors, and the responsibility for an extraordinary amount of data around the world. You might also be using it yourself to analyse your own system's logs and metrics and to hunt for security threats and performance issues.</p> <p>Like any other long-running software project, Elasticsearch has a mature development process and a substantial test suite, but when you look at the details you discover that no two such projects are alike. David is a full-time contributor to Elasticsearch and is continually impressed by how the team approaches the challenges of developing and maintaining such a large and ubiquitous piece of software. Join us for a tour of the development process and the test suite that sits behind each new release of Elasticsearch, and maybe take away some ideas for your own software projects too.</p> <p>**Please note the change in the room location, this may change.**</p> <p>----<br/>Thank you to University of York Computer Science department for finding us a place to meet<br/>Supported by YorkDevelopers<br/>ACCU York is an ACCU local group</p> "

- name: Time traveller's guide to accessibility mechanics
  description: '<p>For a long time, HTML gave us all the semantics and other goodies we<br/>needed to make things work properly on the web. Then we started<br/>inventing new UI components, and now we use ARIA and Javascript to<br/>polyfill the missing bits. As we move towards a future of Web<br/>Components, the time has come to invent another solution that will let<br/>us encapsulate accessibility in the shadow DOM - and its called the<br/>Accessibility Object Model (AOM).</p> <p>Léonie is Director of TetraLogical; a member of the W3C Advisory Board; co-Chair of the W3C Web Platform Working Group; and a member of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Advisory Committee.</p> <p>Amongst other things, Léonie is co-organiser of the Inclusive Design 24 (#id24) conference; co-author of the Inclusive Design Principles; and mentor to young people interested in the fields of accessibility and inclusive design. She is also a Microsoft Most Valued Professional (MVP).</p> <p>Léonie is often found at conferences, talking about web standards, accessibility mechanics, and pushing the boundaries of inclusive design (with existing technologies like SVG, HTML, ARIA, and JavaScript, as well as new technologies like AI and WebVR). She has also written about these things for Smashing magazine, SitePoint.com, and Net magazine, as well as on her own site Tink.UK.</p> '

(Ady Stokes)</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Talk: The mobile phone is dead, what does that mean to testers (Leigh Rathbone):</p> <p>The mobile phone, the desktops, they’ve had their day. We know that for a fact, and Leigh will prove it in this talk. But for testers, what does that mean? What are the future skills they will need to have, what’s the mind-set needed to stay relevant? The talk covers:<br/>• Proof the mobile is dead.<br/>• Predictions for the future.<br/>• Highlights self-development areas to focus on, and some quick wins.<br/>• Challenges with IoT, Big Data, VR, AR testing.<br/>• Take aways to take back to your work place, and discuss with your teams.</p> <p>Speaker: Leigh Rathbone</p> <p>21 years in testing, across 10 different companies, and all companies have been in different industries, ranging from Sony PlayStation, to clinical software. One creates software where you can test a game and kill someone in a game (shooting games), the other, you create software that can actually kill someone</p> <p>Married, 2 children, and love being ‘Dad taxi’ for them. Aston Villa fan, and me and my son have just become season ticket holders<br/>I love tech, and hopefully that will come across in my talk. Massive believer that everyone owns their self-development, and again, I hope that comes across in the talk. I help run Liverpool tester gathering, and I am compere for Manchester Testbash and SwanseaCon</p> <p>Accessibility Quiz!</p> <p>There are not many quizzes you will ever take part in that have only one question, but this is it. What's wrong in terms of accessibility? In pairs go through the sheet and work out what the issue is with the tweet, text or picture.</p> <p>This quiz will help you look at things from different perspectives, give you practical tips and things to do to improve your own accessibility and all in a fun atmosphere. There will also be the opportunity to discuss the answers and why good accessibility helps everyone.</p> <p>Quiz Master: Ady Stokes</p> <p>Ministry of Test Leeds is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all attendees.

  description: "<p>Event is now full, RSVPs will re open on the 29th July for any spaces that come available - please check back then if you still want to come along!</p> <p>Summer is upon us, what better way to spend a sunny summers evening than a does of DevOps chatter, on Tuesday 30th July 2019 we are at the ODI Node in Leeds for thought provoking devops ideas.</p> <p>* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>* 7:25 - 8:05 : Paradigm Shift Left<br/>* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>* 8:20 - 9:00 : ECS, Fargate &amp; the Power of Data MVT<br/>* 9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>Our first speaker of the evening is James Scanlan a tech lead in NHS Digital's Digital Delivery Centre. He has worked in the health sector for more than 20 years, focusing on delivering software systems that support the flow of data across health and care. Through a career that has spanned writing code, designing and architecting systems to technical and delivery leadership, James has a passion for providing high quality user centred solutions that work at scale. James spends most of his time thinking about technology, agile, devops and organisation culture! When not with his family or Dora (the dog) James can be found marching around North Yorkshire with some Explorer Scouts or getting carried away supporting Leeds United.</p> <p>James says his talk \"Paradigm Shift Left\" is a bit of counter-programming for the evening. James is going to focus on the C in CALMS and talk about how culture underpins everything that effective devops teams are looking to achieve.</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tim Edmonds who is a Digital Architect at Accenture, specialising in consumer-facing platforms for media &amp; entertainment clients. With more than 15 years of experience engineering &amp; architecting publishing and video systems around the world.</p> <p>His talk \"ECS, Fargate &amp; the Power of Data MVT\" is about how Accenture have migrated their micro-service estate to ECS using Fargate to help us scale for the peaks and troughs of video demand. Also how they used that same infrastructure to help them experiment and test different types data to improve the video consumption experience.</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - big thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an [anti harassment policy and code of conduct] (<a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct</a>) in order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
