  description: "<p><b>What's happening?</b></p> <p>Are you an artist, maker, hobbyist, tinkerer, engineer or someone who just likes to make things or even just discuss creativity in Leeds?</p> <p>Come along and talk to like minded people and members at Leeds Hackspace, feel free to bring along a project that you're working on or just have a chat.</p> <p><b>So is this free? Do I have to book or something?</b></p> <p>Yes, it is free. Leeds Hackspace is a work-space, community group type and workshop area. We have snacks you can buy at our own Tuck Shop, internet access via WiFi or wired Ethernet.</p> <p><b>There doesn't seem to be many attending?</b></p> <p>A lot of our members, some 30+ do not use Meetup, and they regularly attend the open evenings/days without RSVPing on here. So don't worry, the open evenings happen regularly and every week.</p> <p><b>What do you have?</b></p> <p>Wood and metal workshop, laser cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl cutter, computers, electronics, a heat press, and all sorts of <a href=\"https://wiki.leedshackspace.org.uk/wiki/Leeds_Hackspace\">other goodies</a>. However, using a lot of these things require an induction and for you to be a paying member, but we have these open evenings so that you can look around and check the place out. Some members are happy to help you if you need to be pointed in the right direction or have something that needs repairs.</p> <p><b>So is this a business.. ?</b></p> <p>Leeds Hackspace is registered as a business, but it is run voluntarily by Directors and members, if you want to see a change you can make it happen.</p> <p><b>How do I get there?</b></p> <p>You can find out more details about visiting here: <a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\"><a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/</a></a> there is limited on-site free parking, and on-street parking is free after 6pm.</p> <p><b>What if I want to ask more questions?</b></p> <p>We also have a mailing list: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space</a></p> "

- name: York Code Dojo February Meetup - Code Review
  description: "<p>For this York Code Dojo I'm planning on a doing a session based around some code reviewing. The idea is that I put up a piece of code on the screen and then you go away and discuss it (or re-write it) in pairs. After 5-10minutes we re-group and discuss it as a whole. We then move onto the next piece of code. I hoping to have a number of examples showing bad practice, bad algorithms, bad security, bad performance etc.. If anyone has any code they would like to contribute then that would be great. They can be a single method, class or program. Any mainstream language will be fine. This session will be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg\" /></p> "

One of the pain points for recent projects has been the need for interaction with core AWS services during development. In this talk Chris will show us how they have started to overcome this by \"Running AWS locally\".</p> <p>We'll likely also repeat the group Q&amp;A session from last time as this worked well - your peers are your friends when it comes to getting answers to tricky problems!</p> <p>Under 18’s are also welcome under adult supervision - we can't be held responsible for them but if they're interested in AWS and DevOps feel free to bring them along. This does come with the caveat that there will be alcohol (no, they can't have any but they can have pizza!) and it is at Sky Betting and Gaming's offices so there are likely to be some references to gambling.</p> <p>---</p> <p>We're looking for one additional speaker on top of the above agenda so if you have something interesting to speak about please let us know!</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>• Access statement<br/>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and general car parking. There is a designated quiet space by request at the event. This isn't a hearing loop, or a bsl interpreter.</p> "
