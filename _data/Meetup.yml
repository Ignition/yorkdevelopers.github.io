  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p><br/>February is getting closer, so it's time for us to announce our next event! This month we've got a couple of great speakers with interesting topics:</p> <p>First up is Tom Hanson, with a talk titled \"Making Native Great Again: React Native\". I'm really interested to hear more about React Native so I'm looking forward to this one!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Tom:</p> <p><i>\"Mobile apps are used by the many, but developed by the few. With the current options available to mobile developers seemingly providing a somewhat steep learning curve, we'll look at how we can combat that with React Native.</i></p> <p><i>This talk introduces React Native, a new approach to developing and shipping cross platform mobile apps. React Native has the potential and intention to revolutionise the way development teams produce mobile apps, along with exciting new ideas. These include: User Interfaces and Styling, Native functionality, Testing, Performance, Integration with current apps and Deployment.\"</i></p> <p><br/>Next up we have Matt Collins talking about \"Realtime Apps with Node.js and RethinkDB\":</p> <p>\"<i>Almost everyone uses realtime apps of some kind, they are becoming more and more ubiquitous every day. In this talk, we will discuss what they are, why we want them, and the problems you might come across when you try to build them.<br/></i></p> <p><i>We'll also look at how RethinkDB &amp; Node.js can help you solve these problems and enable you to build production scale realtime apps with the minimum of fuss.<br/></i></p> <p><i>I hope that by the end of this talk I have been able to share my enthusiasm for all things realtime and given you enough information to go away and get started on your first realtime app.</i>\"</p> <p>The main talk starts at around 7:15, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

We have a growing range of completed projects which we can demonstrate such as various spectacular LED Neo-pixel rings and arrays. James has constructed an amazing 518 cube which flashes in a range of patterns, an ultrasonic range meter and a Geiger Counter. The last two can be brought to meetings on request.</p> <p>We can help with any traditional computer project, but of course most of our electronics projects have a computer at their core.</p> <p>We are always trying out new ideas and constructing new projects which include networking the Arduino, using it for controlling growing systems (An Aquaponic system is now being planned) and using various wi-fi based projects using the ESP8266 module.</p> <p>Our 3d printer has racked up over 400 hours of running now and has printed out most of the parts for the human-sized "Inmoov" robotic torso.</p> '

Internet of everything (IoT) would soon pervade all aspects of our life from managing our home temperature to thinking cars and smart management of cities. So it won’t take long to see people suing others for misusing their smart things, thinking cars that have accidents and attackers who compromise smart sensors. The Internet of everything is developing a haystack which contains lots of valuable forensics artifacts while identification, collection, preservation and reporting evidences will be a challenge in this environment. This talk would discuss tools, methods, and techniques to identify, collect and preserve IoT evidence and then elaborates on different challenges that forensics examiners would face in investigating IoT environments. </p> <p>\n\n\nBy attending this talk you would learn about: </p> <p> • Tools, methods and techniques to identify, collect and preserve IoT evidence</p> <p> • Best strategies for IoT forensics </p> <p> • Privacy and legal challenges in IoT investigation</p> <p> • Future directions and opportunities in IoT investigation</p> "
