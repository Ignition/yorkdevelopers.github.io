The event runs between October 23rd &amp; 26th</p> <p>It doesn't matter if you've not helped with a Mission to Mars before or if you're not had much or any experience with Arduinos, C or electronics. As well as programming the robots, it's also about coaching the students through the problem solving process and encouraging them to use best practices. There'll be seasoned mentors around that can help out with the finer technical details.... we're all there to help each other.</p> <p>If you are able to provide any support on any or all of the days, get in touch with Tony via <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>.</p> <p>Find out more about the mission on the Software Cornwall website -  <a href=\"https://www.softwarecornwall.org/mission-mars-october-23rd-26th-2017/\"><a href=\"https://www.softwarecornwall.org/mission-mars-october-23rd-26th-2017/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.softwarecornwall.org/mission-mars-october-23rd-26th-2017/</a></a></p> "

- name: Punishment Driven Development
  description: '<p><b>About the Session</b></p> <p>What is the first thing we do when a major issue occurs in a live system?  Sort it out of course.  Then we start the hunt for the person to blame so that they can suffer the appropriate punishment.  What do we do if a person is being awkward in the team and won’t agree to our ways of doing things?  Ostracise them of course, and see how long it is until they hand in their notice – problem solved.</p> <p>This highly interactive talk delves into why humans have this tendency to blame and punish.  It looks at real examples of punishment within the software world and the results which were achieved.  These stories not only cover managers punishing team members but also punishment within teams and self-punishment.  We are all guilty of some of the behaviours discussed.</p> <p><b>About Louise Elliott (@IvanaTerrorBull)<br/></b></p> <p>Louise has worked in the software world for longer than she cares to remember as developer, technical architect and manager. She is passionate about cosmology, photography, visiting Antarctica (if only), roller derby, artificial intelligence, bridge (the card game not things that help you cross rivers), war poetry and politics and she will talk endlessly about all of these given half the chance.  She believes that people are infinitely fascinating and that managing people is like the most complex multivariable multithreaded system you ever encountered.</p> <p>She has also been known to rather enjoy using a loudhailer...</p> <p><br/><b>Practical bits</b></p> <p>• Doors open at 6 and the session starts at 6:30</p> <p><br/>• The interactive talk will take around 45 minutes</p> <p><br/>• Go up to the third floor in the venue (lift available) and turn left at the top.  Note that this is the same venue as the last few meetups but different from the start of the year.</p> <p><b>------------</b></p> <p>Agile in Leeds supports<a href="http://diversitycharter.org"> diversitycharter.org</a></p> <p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/3/2/600_449916146.jpeg" /></p> '

  description: "<p><b>Matthew Skelton: Continuous Delivery - making it work with Windows and .NET </b></p> <p><br/>The technologies and approaches for Continuous Delivery are essentially identical across different operating systems, but some things need special treatment for Windows and .NET. When Jez Humble and Dave Farley published their groundbreaking book 'Continuous Delivery' in 2010, many of the tools described were either nonexistent on the Windows platform or did not support the rich automation capabilities they do now.<br/>This talk aims to encourage many more teams working with Windows and .NET to adopt Continuous Delivery by sharing real-world success stories of organisations using Windows and .NET for Continuous Delivery; the speakers share their first-hand experience in different organisations and also explore some case studies from the O'Reilly eBook '<a href=\"http://cdwithwindows.net/\">Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET</a>'.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nBiog: Matthew Skelton has been building, deploying, and operating commercial software systems since 1998. Co-founder and Principal Consultant at Skelton Thatcher Consulting Ltd, he specialises in helping organisations to adopt and sustain good practices for building and operating software systems: Continuous Delivery, DevOps, aspects of ITIL, and software operability.</p> "

He takes the discussion beyond the obvious concerns of cost; looking at risk, motivation and solution longevity. A well architected cloud solution can meet demand with elasticity, hear about getting a robust approach to right-sizing, potential pitfalls and cloud specific complications. The talk highlights some key considerations:</p> <p>• Metrics for elastic architectures<br/>• Risks and rewards<br/>• Weird outcomes and gotchas<br/>• Effective refactoring of infrastructure as code</p> <p><br/>Our headline speaker for the evening is Matt Jarvis is a developer advocate at Mesosphere, his job is to engage with the communities around DC/OS and Mesos. Matt has spent more than 15 years building products and services around open source software, on everything from embedded devices to large scale distributed systems. Most recently he has been focused on the open cloud infrastructure space, and in emerging patterns for cloud native applications. </p> <p>His talk Mesosphere 101 showcases the Apache Mesos project as a distributed system for running other distributed systems, often described as a distributed kernel. It's in use at massive scale at some of the worlds largest companies like Apple, Netflix, Uber and Yelp. DC/OS is an open source distribution of Mesos, which adds all the functionality to run Mesos in production across any substrate, both on-premise and in the cloud. In this talk, he'll introduce both Mesos and DC/OS and talk about how they work under the hood, and what the benefits are of running these new kinds of systems for emerging workloads. </p> <p><br/>As it's our 4th birthday bash and Halloween we thought we'd introduce a little trick or treat fun - we're going to have a prize giveaway for the best halloween costume, so turn up in your best spooky outfit and the best one will win a small but perfectly formed Raspberry Pi Zero! No one leaves LeedsDevops empty handed so we have commissioned a set of beautifully crafted artisan LeedsDevops stickers, all attendees may take one home and decorate their laptops as they see fit.</p> <p>Once again <a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\">Infinity Works </a>have agreed to sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there is a plentiful supply of our favorite beverages, soft drinks and as it's Halloween a bumper supply of sweets!</p> <p><b>Code Of Conduct</b></p> <p>Please note that we have now added an <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99\">anti harassment policy and code of conduct </a>in order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.</p> <p><b>Venue</b></p> <p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street (not too far from the Adelphi).
