- name: Air Quality, Lora and Azure Functions.
  description: "<p>Good quality air is important. After all, everyone breathes. But dig a little deeper into the subject and most of what you find is what we don't know. Is air pollution produced by local traffic? Does it waft in on the breeze? Are there times when I really shouldn't go out for a run?</p> <p>In this talk I'll describe how you can build your own connected air quality sensor and get data from it. I'll touch on embedded devices (including the IoT DevKit) the MQTT protocol, LoRa networking, Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, along with the Connected Humber effort to spread sensors over Humberside.</p> <p>Rob Miles</p> <p>Rob Miles spent over 30 years teaching programming to a succession of students at the University of Hull in the UK. He’s a Microsoft MVP with a passion for programming, C# and creating new things.</p> <p>He's written books about embedded development, game creation and programming and is the author of the world famous \"C# Yellow Book\".</p> <p>He is presently working with Connected Humber to create a network of air quality sensors as an exemplar of community based technology development as part of of an open Smart Cities initiative.<br/><a href=\"https://www.connectedhumber.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.connectedhumber.org/</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.robmiles.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.robmiles.com/</a><br/>@robmiles</p> "

  description: '<p>Front end development has never had so much attention as it does at the moment, but what if you could use your favourite back end language instead of having to task switch between different languages?</p> <p>Well, the folks that do JavaScript have been able to do that for a long time now, thanks to NodeJS, but now there’s something new on the scene, something that’s be growing quietly but slowly in the background, and you’ve probably heard all about it.</p> <p>It’s called “Web Assembly”, and it’s allowed many Language providers to start re-imagining how we might want to do front end development in the future.</p> <p>One very good case of this is “BLAZOR”, blazor is to put it simply “C# Programming that allows you to code directly in the browser”, you can now ditch Angular, React, Vue and all those complex JavaScript hooligans, and write your browser based applications directly in C# using the power of the .NET API.</p> <p>It’s still in very early stages, but making exceptionally good headway, so come join me for a 60 minute session and I’ll show you what’s happening and where we currently are with this fast moving target so far, this could change your view of browser programming for ever.</p> <p>Peter Shaw is a freelance developer / IT consultant, Pluralsight Author and General Manager of LIDNUG (the #1 users group for C# professionals on the internet)</p> '

The session will be suitable for people of any ability as most of us will be starting with no knowledge of WebAssembly :-) If possible please bring a laptop, ideally with the very latest version of Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio Code installed. (other editors can also be used) NOTE: Pizza and soft drinks will be provided :-) On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance. The venue is upstairs in the Fountains learning Centre, go into the library and either take the lift or stairs. It is normally well sign posted.
