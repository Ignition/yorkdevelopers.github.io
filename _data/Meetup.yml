- name: York Code Dojo February Meetup - Code Review
  description: "<p>For this York Code Dojo I'm planning on a doing a session based around some code reviewing. The idea is that I put up a piece of code on the screen and then you go away and discuss it (or re-write it) in pairs. After 5-10minutes we re-group and discuss it as a whole. We then move onto the next piece of code. I hoping to have a number of examples showing bad practice, bad algorithms, bad security, bad performance etc.. If anyone has any code they would like to contribute then that would be great. They can be a single method, class or program. Any mainstream language will be fine. This session will be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg\" /></p> "

  description: "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Looking forward to seeing you all!</p> <p>If you're interested in hosting or sponsoring please drop us a line.</p> <p>As usual we'll be providing plenty of food and drinks =)</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>Ric Harvey - AWS</p> <p>A look at AWS Fargate and running containers without infrastructure worries. Using Fargate we'll deploy a simple application and show how easy it is to go from zero infrastructure to a running web application without touching a server.</p> <p>AI Deep Dive, a level 300 demo into the AWS Deep learning AMI and Apache MXNet. Apache MXNet is one of the many open source projects AWS actively develops and releases code for. We'll use MXNet to do some image categorisation. We'll also talk about the pro's and cons of doing this yourself vs Amazon Rekognition.</p> <p>Chris Gillespie - Elder Studios</p> <p>Chris comes from a development background, is AWS Certified and currently builds all projects he is involved with on AWS. One of the pain points for recent projects has been the need for interaction with core AWS services during development. In this talk Chris will show us how they have started to overcome this by \"Running AWS locally\".</p> <p>Nico Vibert - VMware</p> <p>VMware and AWS partnered up to build a Hybrid Cloud service called VMware Cloud on AWS which is launching imminently in the UK.<br/>VMware Cloud on AWS is an on-demand service that lets you run VMware vSphere-based applications on the AWS infrastructure.<br/>This session will provide an overview of VMC on AWS, the use cases and some innovative demos on how both technologies can complement each other.</p> <p>---</p> <p>We'll likely also repeat the group Q&amp;A session from last time as this worked well - your peers are your friends when it comes to getting answers to tricky problems!</p> <p>Under 18’s are also welcome under adult supervision - we can't be held responsible for them but if they're interested in AWS and DevOps feel free to bring them along. This does come with the caveat that there will be alcohol (no, they can't have any but they can have pizza!) and it is at Sky Betting and Gaming's offices so there are likely to be some references to gambling.</p> <p>---</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>• Access statement<br/>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and general car parking. There is a designated quiet space by request at the event. There isn't a hearing loop, or a bsl interpreter.</p> "
