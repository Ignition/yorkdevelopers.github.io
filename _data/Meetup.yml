- name: 'March 2018: Heather Norton - Tackling Climate Change with Code'
  description: '<p>Software for Society: Tackling Climate Change with Code</p> <p>Most people are aware that the earth is warming, and that our society needs to make significant changes in order to stop it. This can seem like an impossible task, outside the scale of anyone’s everyday life. But Heather will demonstrate how one powerful software application, ForeCoast® Marine, is tackling a piece of this problem. She will briefly introduce the field of marine energy and explain how offshore wind farm developers are using this software to try out new strategies in a virtual world, resulting in better decisions and cheaper clean energy. She will share her recent experiences in scaling up the software to look at the impacts of climate change all over Europe, and explain how massive computer programs are acting as ‘crystal balls’ to locate vulnerable people, ecosystems, and industries so that we can mitigate against the impacts of climate change long into the future.</p> <p><a href="https://www.forecoastmarine.com/gamer-mode" class="linkified">https://www.forecoastmarine.com/gamer-mode</a></p> <p>Heather Norton</p> <p>Over the past 8 years Heather has written code for controlling lasers in atomic science experiments, helping entrepreneurs in rural Ghana with their financial planning, reducing energy use in office buildings, and a variety of projects in between. Originally from Canada, she studied Engineering Physics (Queen’s University) and Engineering for Sustainable Development (University of Cambridge) before settling at JBA Consulting in Skipton where she works on ForeCoast® Marine, the subject of her talk today.</p> '

So it will be another useful technique to add to your toolkit!</p> <p>The evening will take the familiar format, where Andy will explain the technique and then we will divide up into pairs to work on some examples.</p> <p>If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift or walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg" /></p> '

- name: Join us for our first Kafka Meetup in Leeds
  description: "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Join us for our First Leeds Apache Kafka meetup on March 14th from 6:00pm hosted by Sky Betting and Gaming in Leeds. The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:00pm: Doors open<br/>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Networking, Pizza and Drinks<br/>6:30pm - 7:15pm: Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL, Robin Moffatt - Confluent<br/>7:15pm - 8:00pm: Full Stream Ahead!, Ashley Broadley - Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>8:00 pm - 8:15pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----<br/>Title:<br/>Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again!</p> <p>Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. These data pipelines can be built using configuration alone.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll see how easy it is to stream data from a database such as Oracle into Kafka using the Kafka Connect API. In addition, we’ll use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and then stream this from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of code!</p> <p>Why should Java geeks have all the fun?</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Robin Moffatt, Confluent</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Robin is a Partner Technology Evangelist at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. He blogs at <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff. Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time.</p> <p>-----<br/>Title:<br/>Full Stream Ahead!</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>How the Promotions Tribelet at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming plan to go faster, why it's important to keep reassessing your previous choices and why Kafka is integral to our future plans. A little story about what we've learnt and what it takes to affect change.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ashley Broadley</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Ash is a Principal Engineer at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming. Starting off as a standard LAMP Engineer, introduced to Real-Time data processing in 2016, his world changed as he was blown away by the capabilities that Kafka offers. Leading the technical side of the Promotions API &amp; Messaging API services, aiming to build Real-Time data models based on Apache Kafka.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>The full address for the venue is:</p> <p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>3rd Floor<br/>6 Wellington Place<br/>Leeds<br/>LS1 4AP</p> <p>For people who have visited the Sky Betting &amp; Gaming offices previously, this is our new building.</p> <p>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and general car parking. There is a designated quiet space by request in advance. This isn’t a hearing loop, or a bsl interpreter. There is a level route from the NCP car park (which has limited accessible parking spaces), CitiPark, and the train station. The venue is on the 3rd floor with multiple lifts available.</p> <p>Car parking: <a href=\"http://www.wellingtonplace.co.uk\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.wellingtonplace.co.uk</a></p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> "
