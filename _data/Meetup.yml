They will be talking about their experiences of building a Low-Latency, High-Throughput Pipelines with Kafka from Scratch. Covering the story of what they built, what went well, what didn’t go so well and what they learnt. This is a story of how a team of developers learnt (and are still learning) how to use Kafka.

The principles and practices are so closely linked, he uses them every day of his working and personal life.
