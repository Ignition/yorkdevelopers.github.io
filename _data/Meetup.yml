I networked with like-minded IT Directors and Heads of IT, sharing some useful tools, practices and insights which I have transferred to the workplace. It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> '
