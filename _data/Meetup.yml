- name: agileYork - The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership
  description: "<p><b>The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership</b></p> <p>\n\nWhile business knowledge and domain expertise is useful and essential, is this only achievable with a 'single wringable neck'? What would happen if the whole team could be encouraged to take ownership of product direction?</p> <p>This session looks at how we have often created dysfunctional relationships with our product owners through both the way we collaborate (or don't) with them and the language we use to talk about the role itself.</p> <p>We will discuss questions like:</p> <p>is having a product owner an anti-pattern?why do we discourage 'hero' developers but encourage 'hero' product owners?do product owners make it hard to have a sustainable pace?can the whole team engage in product ownership?what can you do to support your PO?</p> <p><b>About John Le Drew</b></p> <p><br/>Starting my career in systems administration, I first dipped into software engineering writing automation and data migration tools mostly using Perl and VBScript on Windows. This sparked my interest and led to 10 years as a software engineer, working in a wide range of environments and languages including C, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, VB, Java, JavaScript and probably more that I have forgotten!</p> <p>After a decade as a software engineer, I then spent most of the last 10 years as an independent consultant. Working with companies to help them get the most out of their technology teams. I soon recognised that the technological problems I was hired to solve, were rooted not in technology, but in the way teams were collaborating. This led me to research lean and agile ways of working, transforming my practice.</p> "

  description: "<p><b>Matthew Skelton: Continuous Delivery - making it work with Windows and .NET </b></p> <p><br/>The technologies and approaches for Continuous Delivery are essentially identical across different operating systems, but some things need special treatment for Windows and .NET. When Jez Humble and Dave Farley published their groundbreaking book 'Continuous Delivery' in 2010, many of the tools described were either nonexistent on the Windows platform or did not support the rich automation capabilities they do now.<br/>This talk aims to encourage many more teams working with Windows and .NET to adopt Continuous Delivery by sharing real-world success stories of organisations using Windows and .NET for Continuous Delivery; the speakers share their first-hand experience in different organisations and also explore some case studies from the O'Reilly eBook '<a href=\"http://cdwithwindows.net/\">Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET</a>'.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nBiog: Matthew Skelton has been building, deploying, and operating commercial software systems since 1998. Co-founder and Principal Consultant at Skelton Thatcher Consulting Ltd, he specialises in helping organisations to adopt and sustain good practices for building and operating software systems: Continuous Delivery, DevOps, aspects of ITIL, and software operability.</p> "
