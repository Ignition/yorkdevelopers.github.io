From these specs we can generate documentation, create libraries, and ensure that our users know exactly what to expect from our APIs. This talk shows you around OAS from the beginning, showing how to create the specs and recommending some tools to help the process. Once you have the spec, things get interesting and this talk will showcase some of the things that you can offer once your API is described in this way. This session is recommended for writers looking to become more API-savvy and API engineers wanting to make their APIs more useful to their users.</p> <p>✩ Lightning Talks<br/>Hugh Noble - <a href="https://twitter.com/hughnoble" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/hughnoble</a><br/>Tom Wade - <a href="https://twitter.com/TomWade" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/TomWade</a></p> <p>Talks TBA<br/>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Timings</p> <p>18:30 – Turn up, have a drink, a snack, and a chat (food, soft drinks, beer, coffee)<br/>19:00 – Lightning Talk 1 - Tom Wade<br/>19:15 – Lightning Talk 2 - Hugh Noble<br/>19:30 – A little break<br/>19:35 – Introduction to OpenAPI Spec - Lorna Mitchell<br/>20:10ish – Pop over to the pub for a chat and a drink</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform (<a href="https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/" class="linkified">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/</a>) – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.

- name: Diversity, Chocolate and Safe Cracking
  description: "<p>Greetings agileYorkers! This being our last event before Christmas will have a festive twist and I can guarantee there will be chocolate.</p> <p>Diversity, Chocolate and Safe Cracking</p> <p>Diversity. It's the topic of the hour. Organizations are all putting “diversity” and “equal opportunities” on every job ad. But, for some organizations it still seems to be a struggle. What's the goal? Do we want diverse teams because it's the \"right thing to do,\" or is it \"good for our teams and organizations?” Are we hiring minorities to keep up with quotas or our competition? This talk will engage the audience in a frank discussion on what diversity is, why we need it and how we might achieve it.</p> <p>About John Le Drew (@antz29)</p> <p>Starting my career in systems administration, I first dipped into software engineering writing automation and data migration tools mostly using Perl and VBScript on Windows. This sparked my interest and led to 10 years as a software engineer, working in a wide range of environments and languages including C, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, VB, Java, JavaScript and probably more that I have forgotten!</p> <p>After a decade as a software engineer, I then spent most of the last 10 years as an independent consultant. Working with companies to help them get the most out of their technology teams. I soon recognised that the technological problems I was hired to solve, were rooted not in technology, but in the way teams were collaborating. This led me to research lean and agile ways of working, transforming my practice.</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host York St John business school (@YSJBusiness) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

SQLWATCH collects your server performance metrics, database growth and disk space, index statistics and more. In this session, we will go through the conceptual design, installation, data collection and reports. You can download it free from <a href="https://sqlwatch.io/" class="linkified">https://sqlwatch.io/</a></p> <p>Marcin is an independent SQL Server consultant specialising in performance, development, disaster recovery and data migrations. Following his degree in Computer Science, Marcin has gained over 15 years of experience and knowledge of technical architecture, data analysis, logical and physical design, coding, performance testing, implementation and support whilst working with SQL Server as well as Oracle and DB2 for global brands like Lloyds Banking Group, Wal-Mart, NHS and Solera Holdings.</p> <p>John Martin (SentryOne) | Azure Managed Instances</p> <p>Azure SQL DB Managed Instance is here, Microsoft want us to use it, but what is it good for and how should you use it? Let us get past the marketing hype and take a more in-depth look at Managed Instance and see what we can do with it.</p> <p>To get the most out of Managed Instance you need to understand the Azure infrastructure that underpins it and how this behaves, as well as understanding the differences between General Purpose and Business Critical tiers.</p> <p>There is far more to Managed Instance than meets the eye and if you do not understand the details then you run the risk of spending a lot more money and not getting the performance you want.<br/>During this training day we will cover the core Azure infrastructure components that underpin Managed Instance and look at how these can impact its usability and performance. We will work through use cases and migration scenarios that are available for us to use when it comes to making the jump to Azure. We will also look at how applications that use with SQL Server on-premises can be updated to get the most out of Managed Instance, including authentication and high-level architecture.</p> '

But there are a lot of rules and processes that the team should follow to be the most efficient it can. We’re human and don’t always get it right.</p> <p>One of the areas that I’ve seen be a big drain on creativity, learning and work getting done on time are silos. I’ve made the mistake of thinking it will go away or maybe I’ve just simply made it worse.</p> <p>Tech silos are sometimes problems for pretty much anyone working in an agile environment or transitioning from waterfall ways of working. Or even just a team that isn’t great at communicating. How we can avoid falling into simple traps? Are there ideas that we can implement to get us out of a dev-test silo environment? What can testers can do to contribute and change the situation?</p> <p>Oliver Dunk (@oliverdunk_) - Testing 1Password.com with Selenium<br/>As your website’s feature set grows, testing every user interaction after each commit can quickly become infeasible. Unfortunately, that makes avoiding regressions hard. In this talk, we’ll look at using automated regression testing to solve that problem, and I’ll show how Selenium can help you to maintain confidence in every release.</p> <p>We’ll start with a crash course in Selenium, and create a very basic test. Afterwards, I’ll take you on a whistle-stop tour of the tests we’ve written at 1Password, and show you how Selenium can test more than you might think.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
