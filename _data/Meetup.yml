- name: Amazing Mazes with Chris
  description: "<p>For our session in May we'll get lost together, looking at various ways to generate mazes.  </p> <p>As usual, the session will begin with a description of the problem, followed by grouping into pairs to work on it, and brief presentation of solutions at the end.  This means you need to find somebody to work with on the day.  All languages are OK to use - as long as you can find somebody to pair with!  Bring a laptop, with plenty of charge :) </p> <p>BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME - A good one for any aspiring software developer to attend.  Students very welcome!</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided.  On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p><i>The room for the York Code Dojo is FT/211. This is located in the Fountains learning Centre on the second floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor. When you come out of either, walk along the open corridor reading the door signs and FT/211 is on your right.</i> </p> <p><br/>Sponsored by York St. John University.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> "
