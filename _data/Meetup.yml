  description: "<p>Greetings agileYorkers! This being our first event with our new host Hiscox is likely to be a highly interactive evening.</p> <p>Ball Runner</p> <p>In this game teams are challenged to achieve a series of simple tasks as quickly as possible. The game will quickly introduce bottlenecks, which in turn will generate a high amount of work in progress.</p> <p>Teams are given the opportunity to make several attempts, each time taking the opportunity to inspect and adapt. It covers the key agile principles of continuous improvement, self organising teams, challenging process, while touching on ideas from theory of constraints and kanban.</p> <p>About the games creator</p> <p>Lloyd Jones (@l0p3zj0n3s) originally created Ball Runner at the #play14 unconference in London in September 2015. He was toying with the idea of a game around work in progress (WIP), which can be incredibly stressful for teams, and for individuals on these teams. He imagined a team playing a game in which one individual was bombarded with balls while trying to do something with them.</p> <p>At the unconference, a small group broke out to explore this idea. The result covered much more than his original intentions, but he believes the result is more useful.</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

I will then follow up with a demonstration of a project using Gatsby along with a Headless CMS solution called Sanity. I will showcase how this fits into the JAMstack and why it is proving to be a success.</p> <p>Sam Beckham (@samdbeckham) - Making GitLab a PWA<br/>This is not your typical PWA talk. We're not going to make a dummy application that's perfectly tailored for use with a PWA, then show you just how easy it is to turn it into one. We're not going to talk about how much faster, or how much more useful our website is now that it's a PWA. We're not even going to make anything particularly useful.</p> <p>I'm going to show you how to use the concept of \"the boring solution\" to make small changes to a big application. Small changes that, over time, turn in to large ones. Specifically, my process of turning GitLab into a \"PWA\" in less than 100 lines of code.</p> <p>This is a real story of GitLab's journey to a fully fledged PWA. One small step at a time.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no active recruitment policy, outside of the job pitches at the start of the event.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "
