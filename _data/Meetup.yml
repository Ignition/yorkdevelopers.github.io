  description: "<p>For our session in May we'll get lost together, looking at various ways to generate mazes.  </p> <p>As usual, the session will begin with a description of the problem, followed by grouping into pairs to work on it, and brief presentation of solutions at the end.  This means you need to find somebody to work with on the day.  All languages are OK to use - as long as you can find somebody to pair with!  Bring a laptop, with plenty of charge :) </p> <p>BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME - A good one for any aspiring software developer to attend.  Students very welcome!</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided.  On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p><i>The room for the York Code Dojo is FT/211. This is located in the Fountains learning Centre on the second floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor. When you come out of either, walk along the open corridor reading the door signs and FT/211 is on your right.</i> </p> <p><br/>Sponsored by York St. John University.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> "

The tech industry is high-paced and high pressure, and this means that we may be leaving some developers to struggle. This talk will examine touchpoints such as meetings, code review and timesheets and think about ways that they could cause difficulty. We will think about how we can make them easier to navigate so that developers can get back doing to what they do best.</i></p> <p>Chad is a software engineer at Sky in Leeds.

Systems are now expected to be robust, resilient, responsive and scaleable in the face of varying workloads. Failure is not an option, downtime is not permitted.</p> <p>In the face of these requirements, developers in many different domains are independently discovering the same patterns for building systems.
