  description: "<p>This will be our 3rd donetYork meetup, and we're going to be running a few lightning talks and then a talk on Thinking Functionally!</p> <p>- MongoDB - Kevin Smith (@kev_bite)<br/>- Custom Visual Studio Analysers - David Betteridge (@da_betteridge)<br/>- Using .NET in PowerShell - Chris Gardner (@halbaradkenafin)</p> <p><br/>- Thinking Functionally - John Stovin (@johnstovin)</p> <p>The determined programmer can write FORTRAN programs in any language - Ed Post</p> <p>To program effectively in a functional language, you need to discard many of the thought processes and habits that you have developed for coding in ‘curly bracket’ languages, and understand a new set of idioms and ways to think about code.</p> <p>In this session, John will talk about some of those fundamental idioms, explain why they exist and how they interact to provide a very different framework for thinking about your code. Even if you never write any F#, these ways of thinking can be used to make your C# code more efficient and more robust.</p> <p>He will also discuss some C# libraries that you can use to apply functional principles to your existing C# code.</p> "

  description: '<p><b>Note that this meetup will not be happening in December- a new date is being organised.</b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>About the Session</b></p> <p>So the product is now live and we’ve got users, can we hurry up and deliver a new feature already? Yes we can, but… there’s this bit over there that we’re worried about…</p> <p>As a team, how do you tell a compelling story around the quality of a product, what about taking it a step further and getting the business to prioritise quality alongside new features? It can sometimes be a hard sell when there are differing opinions on what adds value. Quality views involves the whole team in creating a picture of the product, making it really easy to identify the parts the business should care about. Natalie will talk through her experience of using the tool and how it can also benefit any team not involved in hands-on development. </p> <p><b>About Natalie Lovett</b></p> <p><br/>Natalie is a delivery manager with experience working in public sector services and for private sector clients. She’s enthusiastic about coaching teams, delivering products and building a great learning culture within a company. Always keen to try new things, Natalie is currently looking for the motivation to enter a triathlon! Follow her on LinkedIn.</p> <p><br/><b>Practical bits</b></p> <p>• Doors open at 6 and the session starts at 6:30 </p> <p>• Note that this is a different venue than recent meetups - we are now back in thw White Cloth Gallery where we were at the start of the year.</p> <p><br/>• Go to the room at the back of the building.  </p> <p>------------</p> <p>Agile in Leeds supports<a href="http://diversitycharter.org/"> diversitycharter.org</a></p> <p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/3/2/600_449916146.jpeg" /></p> '
