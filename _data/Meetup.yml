- name: 'June: "GenStage in the Kitchen" with Erlang Solutions'
  description: "<p>Hi Alchemists,</p> <p>This is the first Elixir North and to kick things off we'll be hearing about GenStage from Claudio Ortolina of Erlang Solutions.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>GenStage in the Kitchen</b></p> <p><i>GenStage is the Elixir core team’s effort to provide a set of flexible, composable primitives for concurrent, demand-driven event processing.</i></p> <p><i>Our use case is a restaurant simulation, with tables placing orders, a waiter, a chef and a line of cooks ready to prepare dishes.</i></p> <p><i>In the talk, we would map GenStage’s core concepts to constraints in our restaurant simulation and see how our system copes by stressing its different components, isolating some useful principles along the way.</i></p> <p>\n\n\nThe talk will start at 19:00 but we recommend arriving at 6:45 for some food, drink and networking. After the talk we'll move on to Headrow House for drinks.</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge in a recruitment free zone. We welcome recruiters who want to learn but have a strict no recruitment policy. </p> "

  description: "<p><b>What's happening?</b></p> <p>Are you an artist, maker, hobbyist, tinkerer, engineer or someone who just likes to make things or even just discuss creativity in Leeds?</p> <p>Come along and talk to like minded people and members at Leeds Hackspace, feel free to bring along a project that you're working on or just have a chat.</p> <p><b>So is this free? Do I have to book or something?</b></p> <p>Yes, it is free. Leeds Hackspace is a work-space, community group type and workshop area. We have snacks you can buy at our own Tuck Shop, internet access via WiFi or wired Ethernet.</p> <p><b>There doesn't seem to be many attending?</b></p> <p>A lot of our members, some 30+ do not use Meetup, and they regularly attend the open evenings/days without RSVPing on here. So don't worry, the open evenings happen regularly and every week.</p> <p><b>What do you have?</b></p> <p>Wood and metal workshop, laser cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl cutter, computers, electronics, a heat press, and all sorts of <a href=\"https://wiki.leedshackspace.org.uk/wiki/Leeds_Hackspace\">other goodies</a>. However, using a lot of these things require an induction and for you to be a paying member, but we have these open evenings so that you can look around and check the place out. Some members are happy to help you if you need to be pointed in the right direction or have something that needs repairs.</p> <p><b>So is this a business.. ?</b></p> <p>Leeds Hackspace is registered as a business, but it is run voluntarily by Directors and members, if you want to see a change you can make it happen.</p> <p><b>How do I get there?</b></p> <p>You can find out more details about visiting here: <a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\"><a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/</a></a> there is limited on-site free parking, and on-street parking is free after 6pm.</p> <p><b>What if I want to ask more questions?</b></p> <p>We also have a mailing list: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space</a></p> "
