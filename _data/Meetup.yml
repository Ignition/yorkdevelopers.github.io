- name: Come to talk Java, Kafka, sports and betting with William Hill
  description: "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Here at William Hill Java is a core part of our technology stack running through everything we do. Our teams of Developers are always looking for ways to share what they know and also learn from others in the same field. The Java world after all, is fast paced and constantly changing. Just like betting and gaming.</p> <p>We have some ambitious global projects going on within Java Tech which we’d like to share with you. So, our very first Java meetup is going to be held on Thursday 18th January at our offices in central Leeds. On the night, there’ll be presentations from our tech teams plus food, drink and lots of opportunity to chat to fellow engineers keen to learn and share.</p> <p>Planned agenda.</p> <p>Introductions from Chris Noble, Development Lead, with an overview to what we do at William Hill.</p> <p>Presentation 1 - Retail team<br/>Our Retail developers are making in-shop betting future proof – we’re no longer just the bookies on the high street. You can help us deliver omni-channel betting to customers – linking their online and shop accounts. Get involved in rolling out a state of the art EPOS system to over 2300 shops. That’s more UK shops than McDonalds and Burger King combined.</p> <p>Presentation 2 - Trading Team<br/>Our Trading team work on back-end betting systems that span our international customer base from Australia to Vegas and beyond. They code the platform which William Hill’s odds traders use to update the bet prices on live events. Our systems have to reflect millions of real-time, In-Play sports events, so developing systems that are designed for low latency and high throughput is critical.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Good chat about cutting edge software development</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This event is open to anyone with a genuine interest or experience in the tech we're talking about, and how we're applying it to William Hill's trading and retail systems. The event isn't open to recruiters. If you register, we'll get in touch to introduce ourselves and find out a bit more about you.</p> "
