- name: March - Mike Monteith and Ian Thomas
  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p><br/>We're excited about March's event! First up we have Mike Monteith (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeMonteithDev\">@MikeMonteithDev</a>) discussing an idea he's had for static sites and going CMS-less for non-developers. It's an interesting idea and we're eager to hear what Mike has to say!</p> <p>Next up we have Ian Thomas (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/anatomic\">@anatomic</a>) who will be talking about giving a talk titled \"Patterns For React Application Design\". Here's a bit from Ian:</p> <p><i>\"Working with React can be equal parts enlightening and bewildering where the community agreed standards change frequently and ideas evolve at a rapid pace. Having worked with React for three years this talk is an attempt to distill some of the core principles and patterns I have used to build scalable, performant applications.</i></p> <p><i>As a firm believer in Test Driven Development, you'd think we'd start by looking at how to effectively unit test React applications, but this isn't the case! Instead, we'll discuss how to introduce React into a codebase before moving on to state management, managing responsibilities in components, lifecycle methods and asynchronous data dependencies.</i></p> <p><i>Finally, we'll wrap up by comparing Observables to Redux, some patterns for testing apps (see it snuck in there somewhere) and a few obscure tips, tricks and areas to watch in the future.\"</i></p> <p>Sounds like it'll be a great talk and we're really looking forward to it!</p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
