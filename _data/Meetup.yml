- name: ACCU York [Jan 2019] - Option(al) Is Not A Failure
  description: "<p>We have the honor to welcome Phil Nash to ACCU York. Phil is the author of the C++ test framework, Catch2 and command line parser Clara. As Developer Advocate at JetBrains he's involved with CLion, AppCode and ReSharper C++. More generally he's an advocate for good testing practices, TDD and using the type system and functional techniques to reduce complexity and increase correctness. He's previously worked in Finance and Mobile as well as an independent consultant and coach specialising in TDD on iOS.</p> <p>Abstract: Error code returns were bad so we invented exceptions. Much better we said. Then we realised exceptions had their problems - with 52% of a recent ISO survey's respondents saying they were banned on all or part of their codebases! We've been trying to patch them up how we can (with noexcept, for example) - but most of the problems are systemic.</p> <p>So there's been a return to error codes. But now we have new features in the language (arithmetic data types, including variant and optional) - and the promise of more coming (expected, outcome?) - that bring us closer to the best of both worlds - although, perhaps, with different compromises.</p> <p>But there's more. Where do error_code and error_condition fit in? What's all this about monadic binding? A try keyword? What do other languages that are further down this road do and what can we learn from them?</p> <p>This talk will be a tour of the past, present, and possible future of C++ error handling; the trade-offs and rationale for each piece and a discussion of where to go next and what we can do as a community to get there. We'll look at a number of in-flight proposals, and include up-to-the-minute status on them following the most recent standards meeting.</p> "

  description: "<p>The theme for this month is \"Changing Careers into Tech\".</p> <p>Are you interested in getting a job in the tech industry?</p> <p>Where do you start? What skills do you need to learn? How do you learn them?</p> <p>Join us for a series of talks aiming to point you in the right direction including success stories from people who have made the transition to a career in software.</p> <p>There will be no workshops this month. However, those who choose not to assist to \"Changing Careers into Tech\" will still be able to have a 1-to-1 learner-led session with a mentor, as per usual.</p> <p>CodeUp is a learner-led meet-up for adults learning how to code. You tell us what you need support with, and we will do our best to help. With professional developers on hand, don't struggle alone. Let us help you develop your skills, for free!</p> <p>Whether you are a beginner with no prior programming knowledge, a hobbyist looking to get a job in tech or an experienced software engineer who wants to learn a new skill, we run a combination of workshops, talks and learner/mentor pairing to cater to aspiring developers of all levels.</p> <p>If you have a very specific question or problem, please comment with details so we can come prepared and provide the help you need.</p> <p>Remember to bring a laptop in order to participate in the session!</p> <p>You can find more information at <a href=\"https://codeupleeds.github.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeupleeds.github.io/</a> or join us on Slack using the following link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codeupleeds/shared_invite/enQtMzgyODEzODYwODIxLWY1MTZkOTc0MGQ0ZDlhNTkzYmI2YmIxMGJiYzdjZjI5Y2Q1ZTgyMTQyZmZmOTBiZDQzNWQ4NmJlNjc3ZjlhN2E\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codeupleeds/shared_invite/enQtMzgyODEzODYwODIxLWY1MTZkOTc0MGQ0ZDlhNTkzYmI2YmIxMGJiYzdjZjI5Y2Q1ZTgyMTQyZmZmOTBiZDQzNWQ4NmJlNjc3ZjlhN2E</a></p> <p>Space is limited, please only RSVP if you intend on coming.</p> "

- name: LeedsDevops - January 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>Happy new year, we've our first meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Thursday 24th January 2019:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:55 : TBC.<br/>8:55 - 8:10 : Intermission<br/>8:10 - 9:00 : The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>We're still dotting the i's and crossing the t's for our first speaker, but expect 30 mins filled with CI/CD, testing and the odd map! We'll update as soon as we have the everything sorted.</p> <p>Ahead of her appearence at Config Management Camp, Mihaela Drumeva (Micky for short) brings us a preview of her talk \"The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey\". Micky has a passion to automate all things. If she needs to perform a task more than twice, she'll automate it. Currently an operations engineer at Solarwinds, her 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams, from development to test, build and infrastructure. As well as her day job as an operations engineer her main area of interest is in enhancing and automating new and exiting processes to increase productivity, confidence and quality. She recently organised Devopsdays Edinburgh and is passionate about building strong and diverse tech communities.</p> <p>Micky will cover..</p> <p>- What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background?<br/>- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?<br/>- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?</p> <p>Having started her first job as an operations engineer roughly 18 months ago, she had all of those questions and many more. Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey. She'd like to share the lessons she learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>As it's the start of a new year we've decided to expand the range of refreshments we offer, there will now be a wider range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
