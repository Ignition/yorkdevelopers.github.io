Laura, the current delivery manager and Steve, product owner, talk about the challenges of the project, lessons learned and the journey from an air quotes agile project to actual agile project.</p> <p><br/><b>About Laura Clatworthy</b></p> <p>Laura joined a software consultancy as a developer before dabbling in consultancy and finding her calling in agile delivery management. She has worked in the private sector for international clients across various industries. In the last 5 years Laura has managed medium to large scale digital by default services on the supplier side and more recently, client side on the Vehicle Operator Licencing project.  She enjoys working with talented people, promoting an agile, safe to fail culture and delivering projects that helps citizens.</p> <p><b>About Steve Fox</b></p> <p>1996,fresh out of University and with some “education” related bills to pay Steve joined the Civil Service.

I networked with like-minded IT Directors and Heads of IT, sharing some useful tools, practices and insights which I have transferred to the workplace. It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> "
