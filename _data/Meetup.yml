In this talk, we'll look at how we can take advantage of new tools and approaches to make dealing with CSS and components much easier. We'll look at three approaches for styling components, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. While React will be used as the example component that needs styling, the techniques and approaches should be applicable across the front end ecosystem.</i></p> <p><br/>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
