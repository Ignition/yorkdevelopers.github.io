- name: Test Driven Development (TDD)
  description: '<p>In traditional York Code Dojo style we are going to practice the art of Test Driven Development (TDD) using pair programming.</p> <p>TDD relies on a cycle of a very short development cycle: first the Developer writes an (initially failing) test case which defines a desired new feature, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to accepted standards.</p> <p>This skill is a valuable one to learn and also a good one to teach others to do.</p> <p>BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME - A good one for any aspiring software developer to attend. Students very welcome!</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The room for the York Code Dojo is FT/211. This is located in the Fountains learning Centre on the second floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor. When you come out of either, walk along the open corridor reading the door signs and FT/211 is on your right. Sponsored by York St. John University.</p> '

  description: "<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/0/8/600_459587368.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nEver since we moved on from machine code, programmers have been looking for the next best abstraction to represent our systems.  For a long time, objects seemed to fit the bill - conceptually simple, easy to work with, a good way to split up code.  But with the move to increasingly server-based systems and the need for easy parallelisation, the functional style previously used only by beardy academics has stepped into the limelight.</p> <p>\n\nSome say this functional nonsense is just a flash in the pan, the hipster programmer's flavour of the month.  I mean, who wants to swap object hierarchies and encapsulation for closures and monads?  Others say just because the world is made of objects doesn't mean our code should be - and besides, nobody really does proper OO anyway!</p> <p>\n\nSo which is the better paradigm, Object Oriented or Functional?  Tonight, we will find out once and for all!</p> <p>\n\nWe'll split you into roughly even groups of Functional Fans and Object-Oriented Aficionados, and get you to code solutions using your preferred style.  Within each group you'll be working in pairs on your own solution, so you can use whichever language you like.  Once coding time is up, we'll employ a sophisticated static analysis algorithm to prove mathematically which set of solutions is better.  That, or we'll just pick which ones look nice..</p> <p>\n\nThis night is suitable for anyone with at least a basic knowledge of programming, although an understanding of Functional or OO will help. Bring a laptop, if you can, with your choice of language ready for action.  If you can't, we'll pair you up with someone - hopefully with at least the same preferred programming style, if not the same preferred language!</p> <p>Food and drink will be provided.</p> <p>\n\nTo secure your space at this event please email us at : </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amsourcetechnology.com/events/techconnect@amsourcetechnology.co\">techconnect@amsourcetechnology.com</a></p> "
