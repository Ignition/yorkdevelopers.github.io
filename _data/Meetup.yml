- name: 'Growing and Regenerating Human Tissue: A New Frontier in Medicine'
  description: >-
    Extraordinary progress is being made in fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The promise of these fields is that we will be able to create a new type of medicine that is a manufactured tissue or organ. This concept is already being used in patients although the full potential won't be realised for many decades. This talk will explore the very diverse range of skills required to create a human tissue that could cure a disease. We will touch on aspects of chemistry, materials science, manufacturing, cell biology and bioengineering to understand the potential of the field and current gaps in our knowledge.

    Kevin Shakesheff is a Professor at the University of Nottingham and is Pro-Vice Chancellor for Science. He directs one of the UK's main centres for regenerative medicine. He has founded 2 spin-out companies to develop products for patient treatment using regenerative drugs and cells.

    Merchant Adventurers’ Science Discovery Lecture

    While sleep remains in many ways deeply mysterious, researchers are now beginning to recognise the importance of sleep for memory and learning. In this talk Gareth will describe research carried out in his lab that has identified a crucial role for sleep in language acquisition, including ways in which both adults' and children's sleep can improve language learning. He will also talk about the mechanisms with which the brain uses sleep to aid learning, and discuss ways in which boosting your sleep might accelerate the learning process.

    Concussion, Convergence, Computation and the Clinic: What does a computer scientist know about getting hit in the head?

    A Computer Science Roundhouse Public Lecture, given by:Professor Mark Daley, Associate Vice-President (Research) at The University of Western OntarioAbstract: 

    Traumatic brain injury (TBI) directly impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. In spite of these significant human, and economic, tolls, the physiological mechanisms of TBI remain obscure and our diagnostic criteria rely heavily on subjective symptom reporting. Attempts to better understand TBI using siloed, within-discipline, approaches have yielded only modest results. The secret to understanding TBI may only be discovered with fundamentally new approaches to science.

    The 2011 manifesto "Convergence: The Future of Health", authored by Jacks, Hockfield, and Sharp laid out a bold new vision for deeply integrated research that transcends simple transdisciplinarity. I will open the lecture with a brief outline of this vision, and why I think it is critical to the future of the global research endeavour.

    The remainder of the lecture will describe my experiences, and contributions, as a computer scientist working as part of a TBI-focussed convergence science team including critical care and sports medicine physicians, microbiologists, cell biologists, neuroscientists, medical imagers, biomechanical engineers, surgeons, statisticians, physiologists and neurologists. I will focus on our recent discovery of an accurate metabolomics-based blood test for concussion, and novel neuroimaging results that help paint a clearer picture of the what happens in the concussed brain.

- name: Green space and Health workshop
  description: "Green space and Health workshop\nHosted by Peter Coventry from Health Sciences \nResearch Theme Champions:Karen Bloor-Health and WellbeingSue Hartley-Environmental Sustainability and ResilienceDamian Murphy-Creativity\nLight refreshments will be available\nThere is growing epidemiological evidence that suggests that population level exposure and individual use of green spaces in or near urban areas is associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes. These positive effects are moderated by socio-demographic factors and socio-economic status, and causal pathways between natural environments and good mental and physical health are not clear: much of the existing evidence is derived from cross-sectional studies. We also know little about why people from different sub-groups use green space, their perceptions about the benefits of green space, and what the mechanisms of action are between green space and health outcomes.\nGreen space can affect numerous health problems: sedentary behaviour, for example, is associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and mental illness – all major public health threats.\nRecent and current attempts to influence personal health behaviours tend to have modest treatment effects. Influencing the environment in which people live, including both urban and rural areas, could be a promising avenue of prevention of physical and mental health problems.\nThere is growing recognition that public mental health is a priority of equal importance as other public health issues such as tobacco, alcohol and obesity. This is signalled by funding opportunities to develop cost-effective and integrated public mental health strategies that sit outside the NHS and aim to promote and prevent mental and physical health.\nThis workshop is an opportunity to explore collaborations in and beyond York to develop multidisciplinary research that seeks to improve physical and mental health using the natural environment, and to begin to identify and address the many methodological challenges of this area of research.\nFull agenda to be confirmed.\nAll disciplines welcome."

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

- name: 'Growing and Regenerating Human Tissue: A New Frontier in Medicine'
  description: >-
    Extraordinary progress is being made in fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The promise of these fields is that we will be able to create a new type of medicine that is a manufactured tissue or organ. This concept is already being used in patients although the full potential won't be realised for many decades. This talk will explore the very diverse range of skills required to create a human tissue that could cure a disease. We will touch on aspects of chemistry, materials science, manufacturing, cell biology and bioengineering to understand the potential of the field and current gaps in our knowledge.

    Kevin Shakesheff is a Professor at the University of Nottingham and is Pro-Vice Chancellor for Science. He directs one of the UK's main centres for regenerative medicine. He has founded 2 spin-out companies to develop products for patient treatment using regenerative drugs and cells.

    Concussion, Convergence, Computation and the Clinic: What does a computer scientist know about getting hit in the head?

    A Computer Science Roundhouse Public Lecture, given by:Professor Mark Daley, Associate Vice-President (Research) at The University of Western OntarioAbstract: 

    Traumatic brain injury (TBI) directly impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. In spite of these significant human, and economic, tolls, the physiological mechanisms of TBI remain obscure and our diagnostic criteria rely heavily on subjective symptom reporting. Attempts to better understand TBI using siloed, within-discipline, approaches have yielded only modest results. The secret to understanding TBI may only be discovered with fundamentally new approaches to science.

    The 2011 manifesto "Convergence: The Future of Health", authored by Jacks, Hockfield, and Sharp laid out a bold new vision for deeply integrated research that transcends simple transdisciplinarity. I will open the lecture with a brief outline of this vision, and why I think it is critical to the future of the global research endeavour.

    The remainder of the lecture will describe my experiences, and contributions, as a computer scientist working as part of a TBI-focussed convergence science team including critical care and sports medicine physicians, microbiologists, cell biologists, neuroscientists, medical imagers, biomechanical engineers, surgeons, statisticians, physiologists and neurologists. I will focus on our recent discovery of an accurate metabolomics-based blood test for concussion, and novel neuroimaging results that help paint a clearer picture of the what happens in the concussed brain.

    Biography:

    Mark Daley is the Associate Vice-President (Research) at The University of Western Ontario and a professor in the Computer Science, Biology, and Statistics & Actuarial Science Departments. Mark is also a Principal investigator at the Brain and Mind Institute, holds a SHARCNET Research Chair in biocomputing and is the chairman of the board of directors of Compute Ontario.

    Mark is a mathematician and theoretical computer scientist by training and spent his early career contributing to both the theoretical foundations of computing and to the formal mathematical modelling of biological processes. In 2011, Mark took an education leave to pursue a master’s degree in neuroscience and has since expanded his research endeavours to include data-driven mathematical modelling in neuroimaging and computational physiology.

    In 2013, Mark was chosen as one of the inaugural University of Toronto Science Leadership Fellows and is very active in public science policy and the management and governance of high-performance computing in Canada.

- name: Green space and Health workshop
  description: "Green space and Health workshop\nHosted by Peter Coventry from Health Sciences \nResearch Theme Champions:Karen Bloor-Health and WellbeingSue Hartley-Environmental Sustainability and ResilienceDamian Murphy-Creativity\nLight refreshments will be available\nThere is growing epidemiological evidence that suggests that population level exposure and individual use of green spaces in or near urban areas is associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes. These positive effects are moderated by socio-demographic factors and socio-economic status, and causal pathways between natural environments and good mental and physical health are not clear: much of the existing evidence is derived from cross-sectional studies. We also know little about why people from different sub-groups use green space, their perceptions about the benefits of green space, and what the mechanisms of action are between green space and health outcomes.\nGreen space can affect numerous health problems: sedentary behaviour, for example, is associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and mental illness – all major public health threats.\nRecent and current attempts to influence personal health behaviours tend to have modest treatment effects. Influencing the environment in which people live, including both urban and rural areas, could be a promising avenue of prevention of physical and mental health problems.\nThere is growing recognition that public mental health is a priority of equal importance as other public health issues such as tobacco, alcohol and obesity. This is signalled by funding opportunities to develop cost-effective and integrated public mental health strategies that sit outside the NHS and aim to promote and prevent mental and physical health.\nThis workshop is an opportunity to explore collaborations in and beyond York to develop multidisciplinary research that seeks to improve physical and mental health using the natural environment, and to begin to identify and address the many methodological challenges of this area of research.\nFull agenda to be confirmed.\nAll disciplines welcome."

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

Lots of hands-on exposure is the key to learning this technology, so students should have experience using the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), but not necessarily PowerShell.

    Ever wanted to automate your network? Don’t know how? This course takes novice PowerShell IT professionals and turns them into scripting ninjas!

    You will learn why it’s not always OK to copy and paste scripts from the Internet. Or rather, how to understand scripts you’ve found and turn them into more meaningful scripts you can use in your organisation. You will learn how to create modules, functions and scripts, how to sign and share them, and how to debug them if things go wrong.

    PowerShell Introduction for IT Professionals

    Learn from ground up, from the basics from “what is a cmdlet?” through to discovering all about objects, modules and remoting to get the most out of these technologies. Lots of hands-on exposure is the key to learning this technology, so students should have experience using the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), but not necessarily PowerShell.
