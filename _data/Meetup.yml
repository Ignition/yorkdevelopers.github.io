But there are a lot of rules and processes that the team should follow to be the most efficient it can. We’re human and don’t always get it right.</p> <p>One of the areas that I’ve seen be a big drain on creativity, learning and work getting done on time are silos. I’ve made the mistake of thinking it will go away or maybe I’ve just simply made it worse.</p> <p>Tech silos are sometimes problems for pretty much anyone working in an agile environment or transitioning from waterfall ways of working. Or even just a team that isn’t great at communicating. How we can avoid falling into simple traps? Are there ideas that we can implement to get us out of a dev-test silo environment? What can testers can do to contribute and change the situation?</p> <p>Oliver Dunk (@oliverdunk_) - Testing 1Password.com with Selenium<br/>As your website’s feature set grows, testing every user interaction after each commit can quickly become infeasible. Unfortunately, that makes avoiding regressions hard. In this talk, we’ll look at using automated regression testing to solve that problem, and I’ll show how Selenium can help you to maintain confidence in every release.</p> <p>We’ll start with a crash course in Selenium, and create a very basic test. Afterwards, I’ll take you on a whistle-stop tour of the tests we’ve written at 1Password, and show you how Selenium can test more than you might think.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
