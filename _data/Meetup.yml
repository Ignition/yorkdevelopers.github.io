- name: Continuous Delivery - making it work with Windows and .NET
  description: "<p><b>Matthew Skelton: Continuous Delivery - making it work with Windows and .NET </b></p> <p><br/>The technologies and approaches for Continuous Delivery are essentially identical across different operating systems, but some things need special treatment for Windows and .NET. When Jez Humble and Dave Farley published their groundbreaking book 'Continuous Delivery' in 2010, many of the tools described were either nonexistent on the Windows platform or did not support the rich automation capabilities they do now.<br/>This talk aims to encourage many more teams working with Windows and .NET to adopt Continuous Delivery by sharing real-world success stories of organisations using Windows and .NET for Continuous Delivery; the speakers share their first-hand experience in different organisations and also explore some case studies from the O'Reilly eBook '<a href=\"http://cdwithwindows.net/\">Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET</a>'.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nBiog: Matthew Skelton has been building, deploying, and operating commercial software systems since 1998. Co-founder and Principal Consultant at Skelton Thatcher Consulting Ltd, he specialises in helping organisations to adopt and sustain good practices for building and operating software systems: Continuous Delivery, DevOps, aspects of ITIL, and software operability.</p> "
