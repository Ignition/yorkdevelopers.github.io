- name: Azure Functions and Container Instances for reduced costs
  description: '<p>In this talk we will go through using Microsoft Azure serverless and container technologies to automate a recurring process and reduce costs. In my work I was required to create a system which repetitively performed actions against web pages. I used selenium with the page object model as the model to interact with the pages, the code was executed using an Azure function which instantiated a browser in an Azure container Instance using a standard docker container. A transient container was used to avoid having to have one permanently installed on a VM, the container could be created only for the time it was needed. As serverless and Azure container instances have a usage charging model the costs were negligible compared to running a dedicated VM for the operation. In this talk I will talk briefly about:<br/>* Selenium and Page Object Model - how it aids re-usability of selenium code<br/>* Azure Functions - the developer experience<br/>* Azure container Instances - what they are and how setup and removal can be automated</p> <p>But mostly how the above fits together to make a great developer experience and deliver a solution at minimal cost.</p> <p>Bio: John Staveley<br/>John Staveley is a developer focusing on web development with 20 years experience, mostly in the .Net stack. He is an organisor at Leeds Sharp and Leeds Data Science meetups and regular speaker on a variety subjects such as security, messaging and typescript across the north of England.
