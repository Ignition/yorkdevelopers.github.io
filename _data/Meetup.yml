We'll cover how OIDC builds on top of OAuth, the basics of the OAuth Implicit flow, what JSON Web Tokens are, and some recent changes in the guidance around securing SPAs</p> <p>Luke Oliff (@lukeocodes) - Building a Deployable React Client and Express Backend-For-Frontend<br/>A backend-for-frontend is a service specifically built to be consumed by a frontend application. General purpose backends are typically built alongside clients for their needs. As more clients with more features need access, your originally focussed backend can become more monolithic in size and design. One way to avoid this runaway design is to introduce a backend for each client with only relevant features. I'll show you how to produce a backend-for-frontend Express application that hosts it's own React client, so the entire stack can be built and deployed together.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>Good quality air is important. After all, everyone breathes. But dig a little deeper into the subject and most of what you find is what we don't know. Is air pollution produced by local traffic? Does it waft in on the breeze? Are there times when I really shouldn't go out for a run?</p> <p>In this talk I'll describe how you can build your own connected air quality sensor and get data from it. I'll touch on embedded devices (including the IoT DevKit) the MQTT protocol, LoRa networking, Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, along with the Connected Humber effort to spread sensors over Humberside.</p> <p>Rob Miles</p> <p>Rob Miles spent over 30 years teaching programming to a succession of students at the University of Hull in the UK.
