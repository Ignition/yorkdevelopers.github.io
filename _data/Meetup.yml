  description: "<p>Spring is in the air and it’s time for a devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 27th March. We bring you an couple of brilliant talks:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : VeriSM - making sense of digital transformation - Claire Agutter<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview - Bob Walker<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>We are delighted to welcome back Claire Agutter for our first talk entitled \"VeriSM - making sense of digital transformation\". Claire is a service management trainer, consultant and author. In 2017 she was recognised as an HDI Top 25 Thought Leader and was part of the team that won itSMF UK’s thought leadership award. Claire is the host of the popular ITSM Crowd hangouts, and Chief Architect for VeriSM.</p> <p>In the last 5 years, the world of IT has exploded with buzzwords, new ways of working, and the ever present demands to do more with less. Digital transformation is the latest phrase, but what does it actually mean? Claire is going to talk about the changes that are needed at the personal and organisational level for digital transformation to actually deliver results, and how the VeriSM approach has been written to help.</p> <p>Or second speaker is Bob Walker, Bob is one of the organising team behind DevopsDays London and claims to have been doing devops since before it was called devops and has been doing on call longer than that. bob is currently working at dxw as System Operations Engineer but has been the Supreme Ruler of the YAML engineers at the UK Government Digital Service and has only recently stopped being on call for GOV.UK.</p> <p>Bob's talk is \"Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview\" - Ever wondered how best to respond when an interviewer asks if you have any questions? Drawing on his experience from both sides of the table, bob offers some suggestions for questions which will not only make you look well-prepared but also help you decide whether you want to work there.</p> <p>We are again grateful to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
