  description: "<p>Managing change in the 21st century</p> <p>Nearly two decades into the 21st century and with nearly as much time passed since the Agile manifesto was written, what have we learned about change? Which is better: \"top down\", with the challenge of overcoming resistance to change, or \"bottom up\", perhaps never gathering momentum? Is it indeed a dichotomy, or can we find a third way for organizational transformation that is simultaneously respectful, ambitious, and sustainable? We'll explore a synthesis of ideas and techniques old and new, identifying along the way some widely-held beliefs that are now well past their sell-by date.</p> <p>Mike will be joining us the evening before delivering his Advanced Agendashift course (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4</a>) which tradition dictates is always launched first in Leeds. If you are interested in attending then Mike has offered members of agileYork a 15% discount, just enter SHARE15 when booking.</p> <p>About Mike Burrows</p> <p>Mike Burrows describes himself as a champion and enabler of outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation. He is the founder of Agendashift, author of two books – Kanban from the Inside (Blue Hole Press, 2014) and Agendashift (Leanpub, 2017) – and the originator of tools such as Featureban and 15-minute FOTO. Prior to his consulting career, Mike was a CTO for a late-stage startup and global Executive Director for a top-tier investment bank.</p> "
