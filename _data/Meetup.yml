- name: Log Analytics & Flow and Logic Apps with Steve Spencer
  description: '<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, Log Analytics and Flow and Logic Apps both being presented by Steve Spencer.</p> <p>*Introduction to Log Analytics*<br/>In a world where distributed systems are the norm and where we are building more and more things as micro-services we need a way to keep track of what is going on. We need a central place where we can collate all the information we need to diagnose any issues we have without needing to remote onto a service and look through the log files. Wouldn’t it be good if we could also write queries and create alerts so that we know when things are going wrong before our customers do? This is where Azure Log analytics comes in. This talk will introduce some of the capabilities of log analytics, show how you can query your logs and create alerts.</p> <p>*Easy integration with Flow and Logic Apps*<br/>Historically integrating different systems has been challenging and you have needed experts to help you build even the simplest integration. Microsoft has introduced its azure based offerings to help take some of the complexity out of integrating to allow you to build your own personal workflows. This talk will introduce both Flow and Logic apps, show you where to use each and how you can migrate from Flow to Logic Apps.</p> <p>*Steve Spencer*<br/>Steve is an experienced .NET Developer, Microsoft Azure MVP and a Senior Solution Architect at Liberis. Steve has spoken at previous DDD events covering Microsoft Azure, Gadgeteer, Service Bus and Azure Web jobs</p> <p>Steve has also appeared on channel9 also talking on Service Fabric - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby" class="linkified">https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby</a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.recneps.net/" class="linkified">http://blogs.recneps.net/</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer" class="linkified">http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer</a></p> '

- name: 'HaintonDotNet Leeds: Typescript for the C# Dev'
  description: "<p>Believe it or not, there are still a large number of .NET developers these days, that are happy to stay in the server domain, writing code only in C#<br/>While that may be your thing (and I'm not going to stop you) .... you owe it to yourself to at least explore the world of front end code.</p> <p>The problem is, the front end is... well, JavaScript, and we all know how that's panning out for the millions of those that use it everyday.</p> <p>Fear not however.</p> <p>There is a way you can explore programming in the browser, and still maintain all this nice stuff your used to in C# code, things like Type safety, OOP programming and generics.</p> <p>That Way is called TYPESCRIPT</p> <p>In this presentation, I'll show you some of the things that Typescript gives you to ease the pain and keep you clear of the world of JavaScript code.</p> <p>You'll see some of the newer ES6/7 Constructs that Typescript now embraces, but, more importantly, you'll get to play in the browser, while still thinking and working in a very back-end programmer like way.</p> <p>I'll not be teaching you the Typescript Language, nor will I be showing you any majorly cool coding tricks, I'll simply just be showing you that coming out of the server room, doesn't have to be painful at all.</p> <p>About the speaker, Peter Shaw:</p> <p>I'm a typical original UK back bedroom developer heralding back to the early 1980's. I cut my first bit of code in late 1970 in Sinclair basic and I've never looked back since.</p> <p>I've presented multiple times at DDD-North and twice at DDD Scotland, and can often be found poking around in the various UK user groups presenting for them. I help run one of the most prominent global .NET orientated user groups on the internet called Lidnug which is based on the Linked-In groups platform.</p> <p>I'm a Pluralsight Author and I'm the Author of 8 books in the Syncfusion Succinctly series and currently am on writing a real in print book for Packt</p> <p>I've worked with Orange Mobile Communications, The Royal &amp; Commercial Banks of Qatar and many smaller companies and start-up's in the 30+years I've been involved in I.T</p> <p>These days I run my own I.T consultancy here in the North East of the UK called \"Digital Solutions Computer Software UK\", and I build and maintain general I.T solutions to solve any problem you may be looking to solve.</p> "
