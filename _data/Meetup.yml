Since then, he’s helped thousands of people across hundreds of organizations learn better ways of making software, carefully reviewing and revising methods with the greatest impact and return on investment. Today, he leads an effort to modernize Agile by removing outdated practices and leveraging the best of what the software community and other industries have learned about achieving awesome results. Modern agile practitioners work to Make People Awesome, Make Safety A Prerequisite, Experiment &amp; Learn Rapidly and Deliver Value Continuously.</p> <p>Joshua is an international speaker and author of the best-selling, Jolt Cola-award-winning book, Refactoring to Patterns, numerous Agile eLearning courses, and popular articles like Anzeneering, Sufficient Design and Stop Using Story Points.</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!
