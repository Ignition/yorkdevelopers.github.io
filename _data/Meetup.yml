- name: LeedsDevops - March 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>We’re back at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 19th March 2019 for our Devops meetup, here's what we have in store for you:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Devoperability: Putting the Ops back into DevOps<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Reliability Engineering for Humans<br/>9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>Our first speaker of the night is Alexandra Moore. Alex has worked in IT, Marketing/Web design, Software Support and Software Delivery before moving into her current System Build (DevOps) role within TransUnion (formerly Callcredit). She spends her days making stuff better and says that a day without Metal and motor racing is a dull one.</p> <p>We do \"DevDev\" really well, but are Ops people sufficiently engaged in 'DevOps' efforts and do we know what Operability means? We seem to have moved the wall between Dev and Ops a little bit further to the right, instead of destroying it!</p> <p>Many larger organisations are guilty of this and TransUnion are not immune. One of our greatest challenges is to encourage product teams to look not just at deploy-and-run-ability but also at long term operability of solutions. I'll talk a bit about what operability means for us and how we can embed the right concepts early - with particular emphasis on understanding, testing and deployment.</p> <p>Our headline speaker sees the welcome return of Hannah Foxwell. Hannah is delivery manager at Pivotal, where she helps teams transform how they deliver software. A HumanOps champion, a HugOps evangelist, and a DevOps believer,</p> <p>Her Talk \"Reliability Engineering for Humans\" discusses how the concepts and practices of site reliability engineering are changing the way we build and operate our platforms, enabling us to have more meaningful conversations about availability, service-level objectives, and cost. But what are the benefits for the engineer holding the pager? Can we add a human element to our error budgets?</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch)</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any LeedsDevops event are required to agree with the code of conduct.</p> <p>Venue</p> <p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street opposite Leeds Bus Station.

General purpose backends are typically built alongside clients for their needs. As more clients with more features need access, your originally focussed backend can become more monolithic in size and design. One way to avoid this runaway design is to introduce a backend for each client with only relevant features. I'll show you how to produce a backend-for-frontend Express application that hosts it's own React client, so the entire stack can be built and deployed together.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
