Doug's focus over the last few years has been the network performance - fast delivery of content.</p> <p>Here's a little about the talk:</p> <p>Over 90% of mobile apps utilize network connections to download content. However, many apps have not fully optimized the transfer, causing delays and frustrating customers. In this talk, we'll look at how to profile the network transfers made in your mobile app or website, and walk through a number of best practices to identify and resolve. After this talk, you will know how to test for network inefficiencies, identify some common issues, and be able to resolve them in your code.</p> <p>Schedule</p> <p>6.00 - Meet, get drinks<br/>6.10 - \"It's Time To Stop Stalling: Mobile App and Video Performance\" by Douglas Dollars<br/>7.00 - Fin</p> "
