How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?\" In this talk, 65 million years in the making, Andrew Seward (@MrAndrew) and the audience will use Root Cause Analysis to follow a logical approach to figuring out what went wrong at Jurassic Park and propose some actions that can ensure the safe deployment of dinosaur parks in the future. A lot of ideas are banded about in the 1993 film that suggest why things went awry, and idly pontificating about who should've done what and who should've listened to who is not unusual when a there’s a live issue. In this interactive workshop we'll demonstrate how following a methodical approach to understanding failure works well, we'll gain an understanding of what actually caused the issues at Jurassic Park and how we can ensure the next park succeeds. Out of all of this we will hopefully learn some valuable techniques for responding to live incidents in our own systems in the future.</p> <p>Andrew Seward (@MrAndrew)</p> <p>Software Director for York-based HR software company Mitrefinch and is the founder of Tech Nottingham &amp; Hack24.</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

SQLWATCH collects your server performance metrics, database growth and disk space, index statistics and more. In this session, we will go through the conceptual design, installation, data collection and reports. You can download it free from <a href="https://sqlwatch.io/" class="linkified">https://sqlwatch.io/</a></p> <p>Marcin is an independent SQL Server consultant specialising in performance, development, disaster recovery and data migrations. Following his degree in Computer Science, Marcin has gained over 15 years of experience and knowledge of technical architecture, data analysis, logical and physical design, coding, performance testing, implementation and support whilst working with SQL Server as well as Oracle and DB2 for global brands like Lloyds Banking Group, Wal-Mart, NHS and Solera Holdings.</p> <p>John Martin (SentryOne) | Azure Managed Instances</p> <p>Azure SQL DB Managed Instance is here, Microsoft want us to use it, but what is it good for and how should you use it? Let us get past the marketing hype and take a more in-depth look at Managed Instance and see what we can do with it.</p> <p>To get the most out of Managed Instance you need to understand the Azure infrastructure that underpins it and how this behaves, as well as understanding the differences between General Purpose and Business Critical tiers.</p> <p>There is far more to Managed Instance than meets the eye and if you do not understand the details then you run the risk of spending a lot more money and not getting the performance you want.<br/>During this training day we will cover the core Azure infrastructure components that underpin Managed Instance and look at how these can impact its usability and performance. We will work through use cases and migration scenarios that are available for us to use when it comes to making the jump to Azure. We will also look at how applications that use with SQL Server on-premises can be updated to get the most out of Managed Instance, including authentication and high-level architecture.</p> '
