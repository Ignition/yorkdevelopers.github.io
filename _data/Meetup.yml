In my work delivering high-performance, high-availability websites for some of the UK’s biggest retailers, I’ve come up with a wealth of ways in which we as front-end developers can improve performance without the need for any costly rewrites, new infrastructure, or any kind of work that requires permission (and budget!).</p> <p>We may not be able to make the _fastest_ website without permission, but we can certainly make a fast one!</p> <p>Jusef Belkasemi - HTML5 games with Phaser 3 (an introduction)<br/>HTML5 games are an awesome way to use your JavaScript skills to add some more interactive content to your website or to allow you to build a new mobile or desktop game. The modern device and browser capabilities give you all the power needed to jump into this exciting field. Today I would like to introduce you to Phaser this is a 2d HTML5 game development framework that I have recently started using to learn how to build HTML5 games. I hope by the end of this talk you will share my enthusiasm for this framework and start building a game of your own.<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
