  description: "<p>This is a free event, open to all. There will be some beers, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and food provided. We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.<br/>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The Talks</p> <p>✩ Symfony 4 (Flex included)<br/>Jakub Zalas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jakub_zalas\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jakub_zalas</a></p> <p>\"Symfony 4 is a result of evolution of the popular framework. While it's not a revolution, there's lots of things included that make our life much easier and more fun! Symfony was moved closer to industry practices with application bundles gone, simplified directory structure, or environment variables preferred over configuration parameters.</p> <p>Both versions 2 and 3 has already introduced some nice features, like autowiring, that contributed to what Symfony 4 has become. As a result there is less Symfony specific concepts and more standard practices. It's easier to learn, easier to configure, easier to install and deploy, and finally easier to master.</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, our workflow was much improved with the introduction of Symfony Flex, a new way to install and manage Symfony applications. It's time to say goodbye to both Symfony installer and the Standard Edition!\"</p> <p>Jakub Zalas is an independent software consultant, architect and trainer, who helps teams to deliver software that survives change.

  description: "<p>Join us for the 2nd Leeds Apache Kafka meetup on May 29th from 6:00pm hosted by Sky Betting and Gaming in Leeds. The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm: Doors open<br/>6:30pm - 7:00pm: Pizza &amp; Drinks &amp; Chat<br/>7:00pm - 7:45pm: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka - David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming<br/>7:45pm - 8:30pm: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure - Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>8:30 pm - 9:00pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka<br/>- Speaker: David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming.<br/>- Abstract: How Platform Services have gone from supporting 4 Kafka Clusters in 2017, to creating 9 Clusters so far in 2018. Scaling the amount of Clusters to met the demand of SBG and how it's become an integral part of the company's future.<br/>- Bio: David joined SBG in 2016, after background in aerospace engineering. After exploring a range of roles in devops, across SBG, David joined Platform Services where for the last year he has supported Kafka as a service. Kafka is now a key component in the running of real time services for both the Betting and Gaming tribes. David has interests in statistics, analytics and asking the question why? Outside of work he is a passionate sports fan and dog lover.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure<br/>- Speaker: Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>- Abstract: In the beginning was PIPs, an API backed by a relational database used to store all the BBC's programme metadata. But as more clients came, with more requirements and ever more complex queries, the system became unwieldy to develop and use. The Programme Metadata team turned to a combination of a Kafka platform and Clojure microservices running in AWS to produce multiple pipelines, one per client requirement. This setup turns the normal ETL pipeline on its head, with one consistent backend and multiple differing outputs. This talk will show some common patterns used by the team, how they use the microservice approach to quickly spin up new client pipelines, and how the structure of Clojure mirrors and supports the way they use Kafka.<br/>- Bio: Dan graduated in 2004 and spent 10 years working as a Network Engineer. In 2014, realising that the bits of the job he enjoyed the most all involved coding, he changed tack to become a Software Engineer for the BBC in Manchester, UK. He is now a Senior Software Engineer in the Programme Metadata team, delivering scalable and reliable APIs used as part of the backend to the BBC's programme distribution through iPlayer, /programmes, schedule EPGs, and third parties like Sky and Virgin's on-demand services or the American \"BritBox\" streaming platform. He has the world's best Labrador.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>The full address for the venue is:</p> <p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>3rd Floor<br/>6 Wellington Place<br/>Leeds<br/>LS1 4AP</p> <p>For people who have visited the Sky Betting &amp; Gaming offices previously, this is our new building.</p> <p>There is wheelchair access.
