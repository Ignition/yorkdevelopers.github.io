  description: '<p>Session One</p> <p>THREE TYPES OF DISRUPTION INNOVATION - WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS? We’re going to look at 3 types of disruption, 3 models for forecasting disruption and then do 3 worked examples of 3 sectors likely to face disruption in the next 3 years.</p> <p>This will give you a sense of how to know when and how disruption is likely plus what kind of things can you do to get ready and respond.</p> <p>SPEAKER</p> <p>Simon Bostock, Delivery Manager</p> <p>Equal Experts</p> <p>****</p> <p>Session Two</p> <p>Welcome to our first ever Guest speaker at ExpertTalks Leeds</p> <p>HERMES INNOVATION LAB - DELIVERING THE FUTURE</p> <p>The lab opened in a new office at Aire Street, Leeds on October 2016 with the remit to “Work with the latest technology to push the boundaries of innovation in the logistics industry.” Our lofty goal at the time went something like: “Nothing is out of bounds in our aim to disrupt, as well as predict trends that will deliver compelling new experiences and interactions. What Google is to ‘search’ and Amazon is to ‘buy’, Hermes will be to ‘delivery’”.</p> <p>Now, almost 18 months in, I will be talking about all that we have managed to achieve in that time and the fun (lots) and pain (not too much) that we had in doing it using a heady mix of videos, powerpoint and plain old talking, with subjects including robots, digital assistants, a chicken and Google Glass.</p> <p>SPEAKERS</p> <p>Robert Walters, Full Stack Developer</p> <p>Hermes Innovation Lab</p> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</p> <p>**Food and drink will be provided - we look forward to seeing you there!**</p> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</p> '

Randal CEO / Owner at SQLskills.com - Performance Troubleshooting Using Wait Statistics</p> <p>One of the first things you should check when investigating performance issues are wait statistics - as these can often point you in the direction for further analysis. Unfortunately many people misinterpret what SQL Server is telling them and jump to conclusions about how to solve the problem - what is often called 'knee-jerk performance tuning'. In this session, you will learn what waits are, how to analyze them, and potential solutions to common problem patterns.</p> <p>About Paul</p> <p>Paul’s an author, consultant, and top-rated speaker having spoken at PASS, TechEd, SQLintersection, and numerous other events around the world. He spent 9 years working on the SQL Server team, writing DBCC CHECKDB, and ultimately responsible for the entire Storage Engine. In 2007 Paul left Microsoft to co-own and run SQLskills.com, and has been a SQL Server MVP ever since. When he's not tweeting, blogging, or helping someone recover from a disaster, he's likely to be underwater somewhere in the world with his wife, Kimberly L.
