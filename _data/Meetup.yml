  description: '<p>Outside-In TDD (AKA London School) is a TDD style developed and adopted by some of the first XP practitioners in London which begins with writing an Acceptance Test for a feature and test driving the code out to implement that feature by concentrating on collaborating objects and behaviour. This session will demonstrate some of the techniques required by this approach, help you appreciate some of the potential pitfalls such as over-engineering and an over use of Mocking and how it enables you to more easily write better Object-Oriented code.</p> <p>Ian Russell is an experienced agile software developer with a keen interest in software craftsmanship and functional programming in F#.

His experience in high-scale high-performance websites has been a strength over the past 5 years, working for Tesco, FIA Formula E, Universal Music Group, and Manchester Airport Group.
