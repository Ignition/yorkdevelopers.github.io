- name: LeedsDevops - April 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>It’s time for our Leeds Digital Festival event, we’re bringing you two big names in the DevOps and Cloud Native ecosystems…</p> <p>* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>* 7:25 - 8:05 : How DevOps Evolution Happens<br/>* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>* 8:20 - 9:00 : OpenSource security tools for Cloud Native Environments<br/>* 9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>The team here at LeedsDevops is delighted to welcome one of the most respected names in the UK DevOps community as our first speaker. Helen Beal describes herself as a DevOpsologist as her main role in her working life is to study the inputs and outputs of the thinking systems that make up DevOps.</p> <p>Her talk “How DevOps Evolution Happens” looks at how organizations of all types and sizes globally are adopting DevOps ways of working. In this session, Helen will share her observations on where DevOps starts, how to maintain momentum, the steps a typical DevOps evolution takes and the kind of things that stymie progress and frustrate vision. Helen will share success patterns, tactics and highlight common challenges. She will look at culture and climate and how to use psychology and neuroscience to drive behavioural change, advise on techniques to optimise the value stream from idea to value realisation and show how a DevOps toolchain overlays, accelerates and supports end to end flow.</p> <p>Our second speaker Steve Giguere is Senior Solution Architect at Aqua Security. Steve started his cyber security life by being kicked out of his high school computing class for privilege escalation on the school linux system. Since then he has spent time in the aero industry writing software to ensure planes didn’t crash, the telecom industry ensuring that calls got connected and the automotive industry making sure your car would start.</p> <p>Securing production used to be the responsibility of security specialists. In a DevOps culture, security becomes everyone’s responsibility as security shifts left. In Steve’s talk “OpenSource security tools for Cloud Native Environments”, he will look at the cloud native threat landscape. Review how security can be embedded at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, and show opensource tools to assess the security posture of your kubernetes cluster and container images.</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>We understand that attending your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. As you arrive we’ll have an additional room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Shortly before the start we’ll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but don't worry the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We’ll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don’t want to join the discussion.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We have a range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, craft beer, cider and wine - big thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
