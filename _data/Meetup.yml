- name: Agile for Motivating and Engagement + The Essence of Scrum
  description: "<p><b>Agile for Motivating and Engagement</b></p> <p>A story about using Agile to Motivate a Team. Rather than focusing on how the work was managed this story focuses on how agile helped motivate a team to complete a complex task. The story hopefully meets the following requirements:</p> <p>Agile success story Using agile for things other than software development Diversity of tools and techniques Using Agile when the world around is waterfall This talk comes with extra Powerpoint</p> <p><b>About Martyn</b></p> <p>I am a Business Analyst (though relatively new to it) and have worked in the change space for 6 years either doing training, migration or projects. I have limited agile experience, but have had the benefit of being one of the drivers for Agile. I also read a lot and play a lot of games. <b><br/></b></p> <p><b>The Essence of Scrum</b></p> <p>A talk inspired by Tobias Mayer which looks to describe Scrum through the eyes of a layperson and a software developer in a single talk.</p> <p>Tony shares one of the most popular Agile frameworks that, when well understood, allows the creation of processes that organize complex projects within a team. He discusses the core values of courage, trust, congruity, humility, and a sense of service, and then shares the components for high productivity in a fail-fast environment.</p> <p>These are:<br/>1. Empiricism - creating a feedback loop, vs trying to plan everything up front.<br/>2. Self-organization - based on the premise that the people closest to the problem are best able to know the solution to the problem; allowing them to figure it out for themselves.<br/>3. Agility - valuing collaboration vs comprehensive documentation (in which you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want or need).<br/>4. Focus - being able to move each item from concept to complete, without paying overhead to 'context switching' (which is hugely inefficient).<br/>5. Transparency - banishing fear &amp; suspicion.<br/>6. Rhythm &amp; Ritual - guiding you to a state of flow.<br/>7. Emergence - the best solutions are not created. Rather, they evolve.</p> <p><b>About Tony</b></p> <p>Tony Richards is an Agile Coach working on a large scale Agile Transformation at Aviva. Helping teams embrace Agile values and principles through a combination of training, mentoring and coaching.</p> <p>Starting his career in software development working with Toyota. He has worked across utilities, telecoms, finance and public sector. Which also exposed him to Finance, Marketing and Corporate Strategy during this time.</p> "

  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p>Over half way through the year and we've had a load of fantastic speakers so far and we'll be bringing you more as the year goes on. This month we've got 2 great talks and we'll be giving away a ticket to the <a href=\"https://www.dotjs.io/\">dotJS</a> conference!</p> <p>First up we have Chad Gowler (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitation\">@kitation</a>) who will be giving a talk titled \"Mental Health in the Tech Industry\". Mental health is a hugely important yet ignored thing in our industry so I'm excited to have Chad talk for us!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Chad:</p> <p><i>\"Mental health is something that will affect most of us. The tech industry is high-paced and high pressure, and this means that we may be leaving some developers to struggle. This talk will examine touchpoints such as meetings, code review and timesheets and think about ways that they could cause difficulty. We will think about how we can make them easier to navigate so that developers can get back doing to what they do best.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we have Martin Nyaga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Martin_Nyaga\">@Martin_Nyaga</a>) with a talk titled \"State Machines in Javascript: What, Why &amp; How\". I'm not from a computer science background so initially I thought the talk may be too heavy for those like me, but after chatting to Martin it sounds like a great talk for everyone!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Martin:</p> <p><i>\"Finite State Machines are a large area of focus in theoretical computer science, but are rather underutilised outside of CS101. Without going deep into mind-numbing computational theory, this talk explores a bit about what they are and how they can be practically useful in day to day web-development, using a real life Javascript example. I’ll also explore some of the javascript tooling available. This talk is suitable for people with CS and non-CS backgrounds alike.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
