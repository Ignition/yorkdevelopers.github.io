After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>We have two amazing talks lined up for you this month!</p> <p>Our first speaker is Callum Whyte, a senior .NET developer for The Cogworks in London. He is currently leading the team building an app to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy for the NHS utilising some of the latest tech: Xamarin, microservices with Azure Functions and .NET Core.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>How do you scale an over engineered monolith intended for millions of users?<br/>How do you fix bugs and add new features to a codebase that's impossible to understand?<br/>How can you avoid rewriting everything yet make the application perform as it was intended?<br/>How do you do all of this while the app is LIVE and being used by many users every day?<br/>The answer: restructure it into small maintainable chunks – microservices!</p> <p>Callum will discuss the process he followed to transition an app for the NHS into a majestically constructed microservices architecture, the lessons learnt and pain points felt along the way.</p> <p>We'll take a look at the infrastructure components you can use with limited knowledge to get started using microservices, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway to build a large API.</p> <p>Finally we'll take a look into the code and have a look at the iterative changes we had to make to ensure our old monolithic app could scale, such as building a new authentication \"service\" based on IdentityServer and restructuring specific components into Azure Functions!</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tom Parrish, one of Crisp's Senior Developers. C# is constantly evolving so you can write the most advanced coding of your career. With C#8 rumoured to launch later this year, Tom will guide you through the key features and share ideas on how you can use them in 2019.</p> "
