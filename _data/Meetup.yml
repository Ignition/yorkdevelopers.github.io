- name: 'HaintonDotNet Leeds: Typescript for the C# Dev'
  description: "<p>Believe it or not, there are still a large number of .NET developers these days, that are happy to stay in the server domain, writing code only in C#<br/>While that may be your thing (and I'm not going to stop you) .... you owe it to yourself to at least explore the world of front end code.</p> <p>The problem is, the front end is... well, JavaScript, and we all know how that's panning out for the millions of those that use it everyday.</p> <p>Fear not however.</p> <p>There is a way you can explore programming in the browser, and still maintain all this nice stuff your used to in C# code, things like Type safety, OOP programming and generics.</p> <p>That Way is called TYPESCRIPT</p> <p>In this presentation, I'll show you some of the things that Typescript gives you to ease the pain and keep you clear of the world of JavaScript code.</p> <p>You'll see some of the newer ES6/7 Constructs that Typescript now embraces, but, more importantly, you'll get to play in the browser, while still thinking and working in a very back-end programmer like way.</p> <p>I'll not be teaching you the Typescript Language, nor will I be showing you any majorly cool coding tricks, I'll simply just be showing you that coming out of the server room, doesn't have to be painful at all.</p> <p>About the speaker, Peter Shaw:</p> <p>I'm a typical original UK back bedroom developer heralding back to the early 1980's. I cut my first bit of code in late 1970 in Sinclair basic and I've never looked back since.</p> <p>I've presented multiple times at DDD-North and twice at DDD Scotland, and can often be found poking around in the various UK user groups presenting for them. I help run one of the most prominent global .NET orientated user groups on the internet called Lidnug which is based on the Linked-In groups platform.</p> <p>I'm a Pluralsight Author and I'm the Author of 8 books in the Syncfusion Succinctly series and currently am on writing a real in print book for Packt</p> <p>I've worked with Orange Mobile Communications, The Royal &amp; Commercial Banks of Qatar and many smaller companies and start-up's in the 30+years I've been involved in I.T</p> <p>These days I run my own I.T consultancy here in the North East of the UK called \"Digital Solutions Computer Software UK\", and I build and maintain general I.T solutions to solve any problem you may be looking to solve.</p> "
