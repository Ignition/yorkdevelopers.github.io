- name: 'Video: Spring REST Docs - Andy Wilkinson (Campus Only)'
  description: "<p>RESTful APIs are eating the world, yet all too often the documentation can cause indigestion for the APIs' developers and their users. Developers have to deal with annotation overload, repetition, and an unpleasant writing environment. Users are then left with documentation that's inaccurate and difficult to use. It doesn't have to be this way.</p> <p>This talk will introduce Spring REST Docs and its test-driven approach to RESTful API documentation. We'll look at how it combines the power of Asciidoctor and your integration tests to produce documentation that's accurate and easy-to-read, while keeping your code DRY and free from annotation overload. We'll also look at some of the features that are new in Spring REST Docs 1.1, including support for REST Assured and Markdown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XRotk-HQJo\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XRotk-HQJo</a></p> "

  description: "<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p><br/>Please join us for an evening of inspiring presentations from Chi-chi Ekweozor and Clare Sudbery!</p> <p><b>Chi-chi Ekweozor</b></p> <p><br/>Wondered what it's like to build a web service to solve a problem you have?  What constitutes a minimum viable product?  And when it's built, how do people find out about it?  Does any one care?  </p> <p>Chi-chi Ekweozor is a social media marketer turned front end developer and software engineer.  A little over a year ago she decided to tackle the problem of getting questions from an audience up on a screen during a Q&amp;A session and ended up creating Assenty, an interactive platform for asking and answering questions in real-time.  She shares her journey from back of a napkin idea to minimum viable product, and the obvious and not-so-obvious pitfalls she encountered along the way.</p> <p><br/><b>Clare Sudbery</b></p> <p>Clare has been having a lot of fun lately with the following experiment: writing a novel via unit tests and C# code. She is a published novelist as well as an experienced software developer, and has really enjoyed combining her two favourite occupations in this way.</p> <p><br/>Clare Sudbery is a senior consultant developer at Thoughtworks, who was once a high school maths teacher. Six years ago she returned to IT with a sigh of relief after failing to convince stroppy teenagers that maths is fun. Since then she has embraced all things XP (\"Extreme Programming\") and still has to pinch herself to believe she could earn a living from having fun, solving puzzles and sharing the XP love. She blogs about maths, women in tech and other geeky stuff  <a href=\"https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology\">here</a>:  <a href=\"https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology</a></a>  Thank you to our sponsors ThoughtWorks for hosting us.

We have a growing range of completed projects which we can demonstrate such as various spectacular LED Neo-pixel rings and arrays. James has constructed an amazing 518 cube which flashes in a range of patterns, an ultrasonic range meter and a Geiger Counter. The last two can be brought to meetings on request.</p> <p>We can help with any traditional computer project, but of course most of our electronics projects have a computer at their core.</p> <p>We are always trying out new ideas and constructing new projects which include networking the Arduino, using it for controlling growing systems (An Aquaponic system is now being planned) and using various wi-fi based projects using the ESP8266 module.</p> <p>Our 3d printer has racked up over 400 hours of running now and has printed out most of the parts for the human-sized "Inmoov" robotic torso.</p> '

A world filled with intelligent devices that have access to vast quantities of mineable information? For this session, we welcome designers and AI fans Rick Threlfall and Sophie Ashcroft who will help us do a little bit of time travelling in an attempt to look into that future. We'll start with a brief introduction to interaction design along with an overview of the current advances in Artificial Intelligence - plus an idea of how AI has started to affect the interfaces that allow humans to fulfil their needs and desires. After that, we'll get into teams to workshop our way through unravelling the future of interaction as the intelligence behind those interfaces grows. Each team will investigate a particular field; uncovering the interfaces that AI systems will replace or augment and how we might design for the shift. We'll also get into what ripple effects this might have in terms of interaction along with what could possibly go wrong! Let's enjoy a little exploration into what the future of interaction might hold. As usual, our lovely hosts AutoTrader will provide refreshments. Let us know if you have any dietary or access requirements!</p> "

Bring your copy, your laptop, and let's run through the exercise together.</p> <p>No prior experience required. Newcomers welcome. </p> <p>The book itself is <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/\">available online</a>. And has even been converted to <a href=\"http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/\">a nice HTML/EPUB format</a></p> <p>Original lectures by Abelson and Sussman are <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/\">available online</a> too and well worth a look.</p> <p><b>Recommended Software</b></p> <p>The book uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29\">Scheme</a> for all examples and exercises. You can <a href=\"http://racket-lang.org/\">download Racket Scheme</a> online to go through the exercises yourself. You could also try all the exercises in another Lisp dialect, such as Clojure.</p> <p><b>Preparation required</b></p> <p>None! - All the resources are available for free and the point of the meetup is to go through the exercises</p> <p><b>Experience required</b></p> <p>None required. We'd recommend some basic familiarity with programming, but the book assumes no prior knowledge. We've had beginners write their first piece of code while going through chapter 1, and SICP is possibly one of the best introduction to programming available anywhere.</p> <p>In addition, we often work together to go through the exercises, so if you have no experience with Scheme or functional programming, someone in the group can fill in the gaps in your knowledge.</p> <p><b>Communal Repository</b></p> <p>Please add your code for the exercises to the <a href=\"https://github.com/StudyCodeOrg/sicp-brunches\">communal repository on github</a> after each session.

Testing is one of those areas that people often skip or forget about and it's great to have Colin join us to talk about it and it's importance</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Colin:</p> <p><i>\"Testing is important - it can improve the quality of your code and give you the reassurance to refactor without fear of destroying your application.</i></p> <p><i>My talk will cover different types of automated testing  in javascript (unit, integration, acceptance) and some regression as well tools to help standardise code (like js lint).</i></p> <p><i>I'll also talk about automated build tools like jenkins and travis ci.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we've got Lorna Mitchell (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lornajane\">@lornajane</a>) with a talk titled \"Fun with serverless Javascript\". Serverless is one of the areas of development which is growing and I'm really looking forward to hearing more about it!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Lorna:</p> <p><i>\"Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for JavaScripters of all levels.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk.
