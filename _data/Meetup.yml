- name: Promiscuous Pairing
  description: "<p>This July we'll be back at TransUnion (formerly Callcredit), doing an exercise based on Promiscuous Pairing. This is a kind of pair programming where you change partners regularly to promote learning and knowledge sharing by staying in the 'beginner's mindset'.</p> <p>We'll pick a fairly simple problem to work on, and have a go at it with three different partners. Maybe you'll try a new IDE, unit testing (or not), a new style of coding, even a new language!*</p> <p>As usual bring a laptop if you have one with your favorite development environment(s) set up. If you don't have one that's fine, there will be plenty between us.</p> <p>The night is suitable for any level of experience, but you'll need to know some programming if you want to get properly involved.</p> <p>There will be pizza from 6pm, and we're aiming for an early start so try and be here by 6:15pm.</p> <p>* Unfortunately we can't guarantee you partner will agree with where to put the curly braces. &gt;:-/ We'll have security on hand in case any serious arguments break out..</p> <p>Hope to see you then!</p> "

- name: Angular & Typescript For .NET Developers by Martin Randall
  description: "<p>Angular is a Typescript-based open-source web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google that grew out of its predecessor, AngularJS. It is constantly being built upon and improved with a non-breaking, major release cadence of around 6 months.</p> <p>The presentation will be a quick tour around the Angular platform, using it to build a small sample application, along with a demonstration of some of the features of Typescript.</p> <p>Martin Randall -<br/>I've been a C# .Net developer for over 17 years, and I've found Angular to be a natural choice for a .Net developer over alternative application platforms such as React because it forms a framework that offers many features 'out-of-the-box' such as routing, a web API client library, form validation, and a powerful CLI tool for quickly scaffolding new applications and components. The MVC pattern used by the Component architecture will be very familiar to Asp.Net developers and Typescript brings a welcome addition to those that found Javascript frustrating in the past.</p> <p>I've been a developer for over 25 years, working in a variety of industries. I've spent the last 12 years as a freelance contract developer that has given me experience of working within many different teams on a wide range of projects. I've used Angular on a number of projects over the last 4 years.</p> "

Utilising things that combine the DBA world with BI (Power BI), PowerShell, Azure Data Studio,<br/>(there’s nothing like cramming in loads in such a small window)<br/>showing how they can it can be used for saving money on licences, helping with upgrade projects, troubleshoot server issues or the day to day mundane</p> <p>Martin Croft is a time served SQL developer / DBA contractor / consultant who has worked with SQL Server since SQL 6.5, having attending the user groups for many years he wanted to (try) and give something back for all the things he's have picked up from the sessions he’s seen and share things people find useful (hopefully). Martin is a co-organiser of the Manchester Data platform PASS user group and SQL Saturday Manchester, SQL bits helper and regular nice all-round nice guy (his mum said).</p> <p>** Paul Andrew **<br/>[ETL in Azure made easy with Data Factory Data Flow]</p> <p>What happens when you combine a cloud orchestration service with a Spark cluster?! The answer is a feature rich, graphical, scalable data flow environment to rival any ETL tech we’ve previously had available in Azure. In this session we’ll look at Azure Data Factory and how it integrates with Azure Databricks to produce a powerful abstraction over the Apache Spark analytics ecosystem. Both through mapping transformations and wrangling capabilities. These new features mean we can now transform our data in Azure with scale out processing using Databricks and also without the need to write a single line of Scala or Python! SSIS developers – you’re going to love this. For new comers, if you haven’t used either service yet, don’t worry, you’ll get a quick introduction to both before we go deeper into the new data factory data flow features.</p> <p>Paul is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP with 10+ years’ experience working with the complete on premises SQL Server stack in a variety of roles and industries. Now as Data Analytics Consultant has turned his keyboard to big data solutions on the Microsoft cloud platform. Specialising in Data Factory, Data Bricks, Data Lake and Stream Analytics. Paul is also a STEM Ambassador for the networking education in schools’ programme, PASS chapter leader, a member of the Data Relay committee, SQL Bits, SQL Saturday, SQL Day, SQLGLA, PASS Summit speaker and helper. Currently the Stack Overflow top user for Azure Data Factory. As well as very active member of the technical community.</p> "
