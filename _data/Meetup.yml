- name: LeedsDevops - April 2018 Meetup
  description: "<p>It's time for another devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 17th April. The evening will be:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Look Ma, no Code! Apache Kafka and KSQL<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Ansible Enterprise Grade<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>For those of you who squeezed into the ODI for our February meetup you will have heard from William Hill about their use of Kafka, we've invited Robin Moffat from Confluent to come and give us a deep dive in all things Kafka and streaming data.</p> <p>Robin is a Partner Technology Evangelist at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director and Developer Champion. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. He blogs at <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff.</p> <p>Robin's talk us \"Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL\" - Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. These data pipelines can be built using configuration alone. In this talk, we'll see how easy it is to stream data from a database such as MySQL into Kafka using the Kafka Connect API. In addition, we'll use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and then stream this from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of code!</p> <p>Our second talk of the evening is from Phil Cornelius who is an Ansible Specialist for EMEA. He joined Red Hat in 2016 from Credit Suisse where he was responsible for the developer tools and services for 3000 applications, developed by 8000 developers globally. Phil's background is primarily application development, specifically Enterprise Java. Phil brings over 18 years of experience in what is now commonly called DevOps.</p> <p>As you introduce Ansible into your organisation there are additional requirements to make running Ansible ‘Enterprise Grade’. This session is a live demo of some of key use cases for Ansible in the Enterprise. You will get to see Ansible Tower with a specific focus on Application Lifecycle Management.</p> <p>We are again delighted to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

This can lead to feelings of personal doubt (e.g. imposter syndrome) and mental fatigue. The suspiring truth is that these feelings of doubt are a natural response to 21st century life. This is because your brain is designed to survive and not flourish. This session will show how your brain is designed to work, why we sometimes doubt ourselves and beat ourselves up, and how we all can begin to build resilience.</p> <p>1. The dominant survival brain – the limbic regions<br/>2. Why dwelling on unhelpful thoughts can become an unhelpful habit<br/>3. The important role of the pre-frontal cortex in being resilient</p> <p>Dr. Jon Finn is the founder and Managing Director of Tougher Minds; passionate about making complex science simple, so that people can use these insights to be their best and help others to be at their best.</p> <p>Much of his current work is helping individuals, teams and managers in London, and the USA, to harness individual and team success in the challenging modern work and societal context. This work includes supporting developers working for banks, investment managers and high-growth start ups to be at their best.</p> <p>Jon has been working in the field of performance psychology and behaviour change for over 17 years. He completed his PhD at Leeds Beckett University investigating the role of emotional regulation in the challenging transitions of some of Britain’s most high-performing athletes.

  description: "<p>Session 1: Software Craftsmanship and Agile</p> <p>In the first half of our evening we will be hosting a debate on the place of Software Craftsmanship within agile practices. This is one for Software Developers who have worked with agile or for those who wonder how they can co-exist.</p> <p>Session 2: Let's invent a team game!</p> <p>Laurence Wood will be leading us this evening on using an iterative approach where you will create, test and refine a new team game. Its aim will be to help teams to continuously improve. It also needs to have useful instructions and informative packaging. The end product will be a shiny new deck of cards designed by you, which we will send to everyone involved for free - fresh off the production line. Delegates can also opt in to be credited as co-creator in the online instructions.</p> <p>We have built the basic framework for a new card game. We have templates to speed things up and our printer is ready to create a professionally presented card deck. The rest is up to you...</p> <p>About Laurence Wood</p> <p>Creator of the Real Roles Agile team game, Laurence inspires teams to deliver more value, more often, using agile and lean in the UK and India. He discovered lean as a Jaguar Cars apprentice in 1988 supervising V12 XJS assembly and studying manufacturing engineering at The University of Birmingham. Ford’s takeover prompted his decision to move fully into IT with RAD (Rapid Application Development) agile pioneers Marks and Spencer in London. Freelance development lead roles followed in South Africa, Austria and the UK, including at Coca Cola and South African Airways. He later became a development manager then divisional head of IT in the demanding City of London investment banking arena. Now Yorkshire-based, he likes to inspire agile leaders to deliver more value more often.</p> "

Typically e2e testing is deemed to be too expensive for smaller organisations and the team ends up having to rely on manual testing for the most part. Luckily modern open source tools are bridging this gap and make automated e2e testing possible for organisations of all sizes. I will talk about one popular e2e testing framework called Protractor. It has been developed by the Angular team but can be used for e2e testing any application. It is fully featured, stable and when combined with typescript can transform the e2e testing process into a productive and enjoyable activity.\"</p> <p>Katie Fenn - Securing your site like it's 1999<br/>\"Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named \"*~*Ninjad00d*~*\" who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.</p> <p>These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

See our \"Lightning talks\" page for more details:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/</a></p> <p>We were originally brought together by our interest in the Ruby programming language but many other languages get discussed (recently Go and Elixir are quite common), along with lots of other mostly, but not exclusively tech stuff.</p> <p>A bit of business networking goes on (many of us are contractors and sometimes work together) but that's not too common.</p> "

- name: Data & Gravy | A SQL & Azure Mini Conference
  description: "<p>A mini conference on all things relating to the Microsoft Data Platform plus we'll be serving up food with gravy (Yorkshire Puddings &amp; Chips etc.).</p> <p>09:30 | Registration<br/>10:00 | Introduction to Containers | Chris Taylor @sqlgeordie<br/>11:00 | Tune the query, not the plan | Kev Riley @kevriley<br/>12:00 | Lightning Talks<br/>13:00 | Lunch<br/>14:00 | Common issues from the field | Phil Grayson @databoffin<br/>14:30 | SQL Server Operations Studio | Martin Croft @martincroft<br/>15:15 | TBC | Dan Thompson @leedsdba<br/>16:00 | Pub</p> <p>10:00 | Introduction to Containers | Chris Taylor @sqlgeordie<br/>Session Details: Containers have been around for a while now but are becoming increasingly popular and with Microsoft’s release of Windows Server 2016, Docker is now their effective container standard. In this demo heavy session, we will run through what containers are, how to get started with Docker and “spinning up” SQL Server environments with minimal fuss and how you can adapt these or indeed your own VM images to create your own bespoke SQL Server development and testing environments.</p> <p>11:00 | Tune the query, not the plan | Kev Riley @kevriley<br/>Session Details: Execution plans are a great resource when trying to tune a query, but often we get hung up on trying to fix what we consider to be 'bad' operators, for example table scans vs clustered index scans; scans vs seeks; sort operations. In this session we will take a look at some misconceptions, step through what SQL Server is doing and see if we are actually improving the performance when change the plan to have 'better' operators.</p> <p>About Kevin: Kevan Riley (MCSE: Data Management and Analytics) has been working with SQL Server since 1999 in a variety of DBA and DB developer roles. He now works as a freelance SQL Server Consultant in the UK and is no more happier than when knee-deep in performance tuning. He can be often found contributing at ask.sqlservercentral.com and getting involved with the SQL community at UK user groups, SQL Saturdays, SQLBits and SQL Relay.</p> <p>12:00 | Lightning Talks</p> <p>13:00 | Lunch</p> <p>14:00 | Common issues from the field | Phil Grayson @databoffin</p> <p>14:30 | SQL Server Operations Studio | Martin Croft @martincroft</p> <p>Session Details: Anything that can make my job easier and make me more productive I am interested in. There are a lot of different tools out there for the data professional to make their life easier. Microsoft recently released in preview SQL Operations Studio, a cross-platform (Azure, Mac OS, Linux) open source platform for Developers and DBAs. Even in its infancy, it's on its had multiple releases, with new features added monthly this is starting to add things that are missing from likes of SSMS. I will cover what it offers, what you can do with it currently. The session will be demo-rich with information that might make your life easier ( at work)</p> <p>About Martin: Martin Croft is a time served SQL developer / DBA contractor / consultant who has worked with SQL Server since SQL 6.5 all the way through to SQL 2017, having attending the user groups for many years he wanted to (try) and give something back for all the things he's have picked up from the sessions he’s seen and share things people find useful (hopefully). Martin is a co-organiser of the Manchester SQL PASS Usergroup and SQLSaturday Manchester.</p> <p>15:15 | TBC | Dan Thompson @leedsdba</p> <p>16:00 | Pub choice will depend on the weather</p> "
