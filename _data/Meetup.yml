The world of JavaScript frameworks has grown bigger and more complex. However, as of today, we see a few major players like React, Angular and Vue.js cementing their place. All of these are powerful complex beasts with a steep learning curve. Committing to any of the frameworks creates a major dependency for your organisation and a requirement for a specialised workforce capable of efficiently using the framework of choice. In addition, going with one of these frameworks locks you in the Frameworks ecosystem making it difficult to take advantage of developments in other JavaScript ecosystems. As we know the world of web development is an ever-changing environment and committing to a certain technology without a backup plan can have serious implications in the future.</p> <p>Today I would like to explore with you one possible solution for how we can introduce a backup plan for "safeguarding" the future of our JavaScript code and potentially take advantage of developments across different JavaScript ecosystems. This potential Solution is to build Web Components using our chosen JavaScript framework. I will talk about some of the options we have today with the top 3 JS frameworks and show a quick demo of how this can be done with Angular 6."</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: Log Analytics & Flow and Logic Apps with Steve Spencer
  description: '<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, Log Analytics and Flow and Logic Apps both being presented by Steve Spencer.</p> <p>*Introduction to Log Analytics*<br/>In a world where distributed systems are the norm and where we are building more and more things as micro-services we need a way to keep track of what is going on. We need a central place where we can collate all the information we need to diagnose any issues we have without needing to remote onto a service and look through the log files. Wouldn’t it be good if we could also write queries and create alerts so that we know when things are going wrong before our customers do? This is where Azure Log analytics comes in. This talk will introduce some of the capabilities of log analytics, show how you can query your logs and create alerts.</p> <p>*Easy integration with Flow and Logic Apps*<br/>Historically integrating different systems has been challenging and you have needed experts to help you build even the simplest integration. Microsoft has introduced its azure based offerings to help take some of the complexity out of integrating to allow you to build your own personal workflows. This talk will introduce both Flow and Logic apps, show you where to use each and how you can migrate from Flow to Logic Apps.</p> <p>*Steve Spencer*<br/>Steve is an experienced .NET Developer, Microsoft Azure MVP and a Senior Solution Architect at Liberis. Steve has spoken at previous DDD events covering Microsoft Azure, Gadgeteer, Service Bus and Azure Web jobs</p> <p>Steve has also appeared on channel9 also talking on Service Fabric - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby" class="linkified">https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby</a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.recneps.net/" class="linkified">http://blogs.recneps.net/</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer" class="linkified">http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer</a></p> '
