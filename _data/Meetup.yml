  description: "<p>*** Please note that we will be starting at 7pm on Wednesday 17th April ***</p> <p>Greetings agileYorkers! This being our first event with our new host Hiscox is likely to be a highly interactive evening.</p> <p>Ball Runner</p> <p>In this game teams are challenged to achieve a series of simple tasks as quickly as possible. The game will quickly introduce bottlenecks, which in turn will generate a high amount of work in progress.</p> <p>Teams are given the opportunity to make several attempts, each time taking the opportunity to inspect and adapt. It covers the key agile principles of continuous improvement, self organising teams, challenging process, while touching on ideas from theory of constraints and kanban.</p> <p>About the games creator</p> <p>Lloyd Jones (@l0p3zj0n3s) originally created Ball Runner at the #play14 unconference in London in September 2015. He was toying with the idea of a game around work in progress (WIP), which can be incredibly stressful for teams, and for individuals on these teams. He imagined a team playing a game in which one individual was bombarded with balls while trying to do something with them.</p> <p>At the unconference, a small group broke out to explore this idea. The result covered much more than his original intentions, but he believes the result is more useful.</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group! You can earn SEUs by attending our events. ***</p> "

I will then follow up with a demonstration of a project using Gatsby along with a Headless CMS solution called Sanity. I will showcase how this fits into the JAMstack and why it is proving to be a success.</p> <p>Sam Beckham (@samdbeckham) - Making GitLab a PWA<br/>This is not your typical PWA talk. We're not going to make a dummy application that's perfectly tailored for use with a PWA, then show you just how easy it is to turn it into one. We're not going to talk about how much faster, or how much more useful our website is now that it's a PWA. We're not even going to make anything particularly useful.</p> <p>I'm going to show you how to use the concept of \"the boring solution\" to make small changes to a big application. Small changes that, over time, turn in to large ones. Specifically, my process of turning GitLab into a \"PWA\" in less than 100 lines of code.</p> <p>This is a real story of GitLab's journey to a fully fledged PWA. One small step at a time.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: ACCU York [Apr 2019] - Quickly testing legacy code
  description: "<p>This month we welcome Clare Macrae to ACCU York.</p> <p>Talk Detail:<br/>You've inherited some legacy code: it's valuable, but it doesn't have tests, and it wasn't designed to be testable, so you need to start refactoring! But you can't refactor safely until the code has tests, and you can't add tests without refactoring. How can you ever break out of this painful loop?</p> <p>Clare will present a powerful approach to solve exactly this problem, in both legacy and green-field systems: Llewellyn Falco's \"Approval Tests\". In addition to its existing implementations for Python, .NET, Java, NodeJS, Swift and others, there is now a C++ version.</p> <p>She will describe the use of Approval Tests in some real-world situations, including how to quickly lock down the behaviour of legacy code. She will show how to rapidly achieve good test coverage, even for very large sets of inputs. Finally, she will also describe some general techniques I learned along the way.</p> <p>About Clare Macrae:<br/>Clare has worked in technology for over 30 years, and is a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. When not thinking about supporting teams to streamline development and releases, she spends time with family and friends, and more recently, also contributes C++ code to the CycleStreets journey planner.</p> <p>----<br/>Thank you York Science Park for providing us a place to meet<br/>Supported by YorkDevelopers<br/>ACCU York is an ACCU local group</p> "

- name: LeedsDevops - April 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>It’s time for our Leeds Digital Festival event, we’re bringing you two big names in the DevOps and Cloud Native ecosystems…</p> <p>* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>* 7:25 - 8:05 : OpenSource security tools for Cloud Native Environments<br/>* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>* 8:20 - 9:00 : How DevOps Evolution Happens<br/>* 9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>Our first speaker Steve Giguere is Senior Solution Architect at Aqua Security. Steve started his cyber security life by being kicked out of his high school computing class for privilege escalation on the school linux system. Since then he has spent time in the aero industry writing software to ensure planes didn’t crash, the telecom industry ensuring that calls got connected and the automotive industry making sure your car would start.</p> <p>Securing production used to be the responsibility of security specialists. In a DevOps culture, security becomes everyone’s responsibility as security shifts left. In Steve’s talk “OpenSource security tools for Cloud Native Environments”, he will look at the cloud native threat landscape. Review how security can be embedded at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, and show opensource tools to assess the security posture of your kubernetes cluster and container images.</p> <p>The team here at LeedsDevops is delighted to welcome one of the most respected names in the UK DevOps community as our headline speaker. Helen Beal describes herself as a DevOpsologist as her main role in her working life is to study the inputs and outputs of the thinking systems that make up DevOps.</p> <p>Her talk “How DevOps Evolution Happens” looks at how organizations of all types and sizes globally are adopting DevOps ways of working. In this session, Helen will share her observations on where DevOps starts, how to maintain momentum, the steps a typical DevOps evolution takes and the kind of things that stymie progress and frustrate vision. Helen will share success patterns, tactics and highlight common challenges. She will look at culture and climate and how to use psychology and neuroscience to drive behavioural change, advise on techniques to optimise the value stream from idea to value realisation and show how a DevOps toolchain overlays, accelerates and supports end to end flow.</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>We understand that attending your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. As you arrive we’ll have an additional room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Shortly before the start we’ll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but don't worry the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We’ll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don’t want to join the discussion.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We have a range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, craft beer, cider and wine - big thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
