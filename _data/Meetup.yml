  description: '<p>Cake (C# Make) Build / #FAIL - Lessons from infosec incidents</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park will be teaching us how we can build anywhere by using cake build and Robin Minto will be walking us through challenges securing a web application.</p> <p>A Piece of Cake - C# powered cross platform build automation</p> <p>Have you ever wanted to create a build script for your application, but been faced with learning a new language, or DSL, or writing more XML than any person should ever need to? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?</p> <p>If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then the Cake ( <a href="http://cakebuild.net/" class="linkified">http://cakebuild.net/</a> ) Build Automation System is for you!In this session we will start with a standard .Net Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, using the C# skills that you may already have.</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park (@gep13 (<a href="https://twitter.com/gep13" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/gep13</a>))</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park has been developing on the .Net Platform for almost 10 years. His day job sees him developing using ASP.NET, AngularJS, and WPF, for Oil Companies working in the North Sea.</p> <p>In his spare time, Gary contributes to a number of Open Source projects including Chocolatey, Boxstarter, Cake, psake and GitVersion.</p> <p>Gary is a founding member of the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group, that holds monthly sessions on any topic related to the Microsoft .Net Technology Stack.</p> <p>#FAIL - Lessons from infosec incidents</p> <p>Securing a web application is a challenge. The internet is awash with malicious traffic and web applications are globally accessible. Don’t make it easy for them and the baddies will move on and find someone else to annoy.<br/>We’ll look at the risks facing web applications, the basic steps you can take so that you don’t make yourself a target and the things you should do to avoid becoming a data breach statistic. We’ll also look at lessons that can be learnt from mistakes that others have made.<br/>We’ll demo some of the techniques and tools in both attack and defence with examples for any web application developer.</p> '

- name: York Code Dojo February Meetup - Code Review
  description: "<p>For this York Code Dojo I'm planning on a doing a session based around some code reviewing. The idea is that I put up a piece of code on the screen and then you go away and discuss it (or re-write it) in pairs. After 5-10minutes we re-group and discuss it as a whole. We then move onto the next piece of code. I hoping to have a number of examples showing bad practice, bad algorithms, bad security, bad performance etc.. If anyone has any code they would like to contribute then that would be great. They can be a single method, class or program. Any mainstream language will be fine. This session will be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg\" /></p> "
