- name: ACCU York [July 2019] - Developing Elasticsearch
  description: "<p>If you've ever searched Wikipedia, bought something on eBay, caught an Uber, or flown out of Stansted Airport you've used a system called Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is a versatile open-source distributed search engine with a decade of history, thousands of contributors, and the responsibility for an extraordinary amount of data around the world. You might also be using it yourself to analyse your own system's logs and metrics and to hunt for security threats and performance issues.</p> <p>Like any other long-running software project, Elasticsearch has a mature development process and a substantial test suite, but when you look at the details you discover that no two such projects are alike. David is a full-time contributor to Elasticsearch and is continually impressed by how the team approaches the challenges of developing and maintaining such a large and ubiquitous piece of software. Join us for a tour of the development process and the test suite that sits behind each new release of Elasticsearch, and maybe take away some ideas for your own software projects too.</p> <p>**Please note the change in the room location, this may change.**</p> <p>----<br/>Thank you to University of York Computer Science department for finding us a place to meet<br/>Supported by YorkDevelopers<br/>ACCU York is an ACCU local group</p> "

- name: Time traveller's guide to accessibility mechanics
  description: '<p>For a long time, HTML gave us all the semantics and other goodies we<br/>needed to make things work properly on the web. Then we started<br/>inventing new UI components, and now we use ARIA and Javascript to<br/>polyfill the missing bits. As we move towards a future of Web<br/>Components, the time has come to invent another solution that will let<br/>us encapsulate accessibility in the shadow DOM - and its called the<br/>Accessibility Object Model (AOM).</p> <p>Léonie is Director of TetraLogical; a member of the W3C Advisory Board; co-Chair of the W3C Web Platform Working Group; and a member of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Advisory Committee.</p> <p>Amongst other things, Léonie is co-organiser of the Inclusive Design 24 (#id24) conference; co-author of the Inclusive Design Principles; and mentor to young people interested in the fields of accessibility and inclusive design. She is also a Microsoft Most Valued Professional (MVP).</p> <p>Léonie is often found at conferences, talking about web standards, accessibility mechanics, and pushing the boundaries of inclusive design (with existing technologies like SVG, HTML, ARIA, and JavaScript, as well as new technologies like AI and WebVR). She has also written about these things for Smashing magazine, SitePoint.com, and Net magazine, as well as on her own site Tink.UK.</p> '

(Ady Stokes)</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Talk: The mobile phone is dead, what does that mean to testers (Leigh Rathbone):</p> <p>The mobile phone, the desktops, they’ve had their day. We know that for a fact, and Leigh will prove it in this talk. But for testers, what does that mean? What are the future skills they will need to have, what’s the mind-set needed to stay relevant? The talk covers:<br/>• Proof the mobile is dead.<br/>• Predictions for the future.<br/>• Highlights self-development areas to focus on, and some quick wins.<br/>• Challenges with IoT, Big Data, VR, AR testing.<br/>• Take aways to take back to your work place, and discuss with your teams.</p> <p>Speaker: Leigh Rathbone</p> <p>21 years in testing, across 10 different companies, and all companies have been in different industries, ranging from Sony PlayStation, to clinical software. One creates software where you can test a game and kill someone in a game (shooting games), the other, you create software that can actually kill someone</p> <p>Married, 2 children, and love being ‘Dad taxi’ for them. Aston Villa fan, and me and my son have just become season ticket holders<br/>I love tech, and hopefully that will come across in my talk. Massive believer that everyone owns their self-development, and again, I hope that comes across in the talk. I help run Liverpool tester gathering, and I am compere for Manchester Testbash and SwanseaCon</p> <p>Accessibility Quiz!</p> <p>There are not many quizzes you will ever take part in that have only one question, but this is it. What's wrong in terms of accessibility? In pairs go through the sheet and work out what the issue is with the tweet, text or picture.</p> <p>This quiz will help you look at things from different perspectives, give you practical tips and things to do to improve your own accessibility and all in a fun atmosphere. There will also be the opportunity to discuss the answers and why good accessibility helps everyone.</p> <p>Quiz Master: Ady Stokes</p> <p>Ministry of Test Leeds is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all attendees. To discuss any additional accessibility requirements you may have, please contact [masked].</p> "
