- name: Tests Make Good Architects & Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer
  description: '<p>This is a free event, open to all. There will be some beers, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and food provided. We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The talks</p> <p>✩ Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns (@SamBurnsUK)</p> <p>This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture. Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages. We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.</p> <p>✩ Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell (@JasonBruce88)</p> <p>Starting as a Junior Developer can be both exciting and overwhelming. Hopefully we can help you avoid common pitfalls and help you be a more confident developer, sooner rather than later.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Timings</p> <p>18:30 – Turn up, have a drink, a snack, and a chat (food, soft drinks, beer, coffee)<br/>19:00 – Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell<br/>19:30 – A little break<br/>19:35 – Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns<br/>20:10ish – Pop over to the pub for a chat and a drink</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform (<a href="https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/" class="linkified">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/</a>) – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.
