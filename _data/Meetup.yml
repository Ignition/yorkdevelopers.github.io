We'll cover how OIDC builds on top of OAuth, the basics of the OAuth Implicit flow, what JSON Web Tokens are, and some recent changes in the guidance around securing SPAs</p> <p>Luke Oliff (@lukeocodes) - Building a Deployable React Client and Express Backend-For-Frontend<br/>A backend-for-frontend is a service specifically built to be consumed by a frontend application. General purpose backends are typically built alongside clients for their needs. As more clients with more features need access, your originally focussed backend can become more monolithic in size and design. One way to avoid this runaway design is to introduce a backend for each client with only relevant features. I'll show you how to produce a backend-for-frontend Express application that hosts it's own React client, so the entire stack can be built and deployed together.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no active recruitment policy, outside of the job pitches at the start of the event.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "
