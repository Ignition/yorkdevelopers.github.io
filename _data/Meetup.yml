Utilising things that combine the DBA world with BI (Power BI), PowerShell, Azure Data Studio,<br/>(there’s nothing like cramming in loads in such a small window)<br/>showing how they can it can be used for saving money on licences, helping with upgrade projects, troubleshoot server issues or the day to day mundane</p> <p>Martin Croft is a time served SQL developer / DBA contractor / consultant who has worked with SQL Server since SQL 6.5, having attending the user groups for many years he wanted to (try) and give something back for all the things he's have picked up from the sessions he’s seen and share things people find useful (hopefully). Martin is a co-organiser of the Manchester Data platform PASS user group and SQL Saturday Manchester, SQL bits helper and regular nice all-round nice guy (his mum said).</p> <p>** Paul Andrew **<br/>[ETL in Azure made easy with Data Factory Data Flow]</p> <p>What happens when you combine a cloud orchestration service with a Spark cluster?! The answer is a feature rich, graphical, scalable data flow environment to rival any ETL tech we’ve previously had available in Azure. In this session we’ll look at Azure Data Factory and how it integrates with Azure Databricks to produce a powerful abstraction over the Apache Spark analytics ecosystem. Both through mapping transformations and wrangling capabilities. These new features mean we can now transform our data in Azure with scale out processing using Databricks and also without the need to write a single line of Scala or Python! SSIS developers – you’re going to love this. For new comers, if you haven’t used either service yet, don’t worry, you’ll get a quick introduction to both before we go deeper into the new data factory data flow features.</p> <p>Paul is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP with 10+ years’ experience working with the complete on premises SQL Server stack in a variety of roles and industries. Now as Data Analytics Consultant has turned his keyboard to big data solutions on the Microsoft cloud platform. Specialising in Data Factory, Data Bricks, Data Lake and Stream Analytics. Paul is also a STEM Ambassador for the networking education in schools’ programme, PASS chapter leader, a member of the Data Relay committee, SQL Bits, SQL Saturday, SQL Day, SQLGLA, PASS Summit speaker and helper. Currently the Stack Overflow top user for Azure Data Factory. As well as very active member of the technical community.</p> "
