- name: The Game Has Changed with Jeff Patton
  description: "<p>About the session</p> <p>We all know how fast technology changes. But, we sometimes fail to understand how fast our process needs to change to keep up. This talk is about how 21st century software development has thrown out most of the process assumptions you might have originally learned. In this talk, Jeff Patton will explain how Product Thinking, Lean Startup Thinking, and Continuous Delivery has fundamentally changed how we design and build software.</p> <p>Agenda for the evening:</p> <p>● 18:30 - Networking, food and drinks<br/>● 19:00 - Talk<br/>● 20:15 - More networking and drinks<br/>● 20:30 - Departure</p> <p>About Jeff</p> <p>Jeff makes use of over 20 years of product design and development experience to help companies create great products.</p> <p>Jeff started in software development in the early 90s as a project leader and senior developer for a small software product company. There he learned that well written code, and fast delivery isn’t the secret to success, it’s just table stakes. It’s actually deep understanding of your customers and users coupled with a desire to create a product that’s really valuable to them that makes the biggest difference.</p> <p>In 2000 Jeff worked as a product manager at one of the first companies adopting Extreme Programming. It was there he built a strong appreciation for the discipline that Agile thinking brings to software development and a deep concern for what seemed to be left out, specifically good product thinking. Since then Jeff has been an evangelist championing the inclusion of strong product design and user experience practice in Agile development. Today Jeff teaches and coaches a contemporary blend of practice that incorporates Lean and Lean Startup and Design Thinking all directed at helping organizations build products their customers love.</p> <p>Jeff’s a Certified Scrum Trainer, and winner of the Agile Alliance’s 2007 Gordon Pask Award for contributions to Agile Development. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.</p> <p>User Story Mapping - Book Giveaway</p> <p>We'll be giving away a copy of Jeff's excellent \"User Story Mapping\" book to a lucky person picked at random on the night at the meetup.</p> <p>*agileYork supports <a href=\"http://diversitycharter.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://diversitycharter.org</a> *</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

He will augment this with Logic Apps to power a Xamarin Forms app. The app itself has some new features from the latest 4.0 release, including the new CollectionView.</p> <p>Visual Studio App Center allows developers to ship better apps through a suit of functions including automated builds, testing, crash and analytics reporting as well as push notifications. I’ll quickly cover these existing features before moving onto to showing two new preview features released earlier this year; authentication and data.</p> <p>The addition of Authentication and Data to App Center takes it from a DevOps tool to a fully fledge Mobile Backend as a Service! This session has been created to help you understand you can get started with the new features in the context of Xamarin.Forms. I’ll also show how you can extend the functionality through Azure Logic Apps to create a global scale backend with zero lines of code.</p> <p>As experts, I’d love to hear your feedback as we look to add new features and functionality to App Center</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:30 Pizza, drinks &amp; chat<br/>19:00 Leeds Sharp introduction and industry news<br/>19:15 Kaizen Bits<br/>19:30 Design Pattern Recognition<br/>19:45 Break<br/>20:00 Main talk - Build global scale mobile apps with C#<br/>21:00 The Brewery Tap for drinks and chats</p> '
