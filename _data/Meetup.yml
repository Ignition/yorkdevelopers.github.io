Having qualified in the pharmacy industry his career has been tightly coupled with healthcare. He has worked primarily on the operational side of IT, for the last 7 years providing technical solutions for delivering large enterprise applications to NHS organisations for EMIS Health. Today he focuses on how they can deliver faster and to more complex environments.</p> <p>Sam will walk you through how EMIS are exploring and adopting a hybrid on-prem-cloud solution along with the Hashicorp toolset, to provide more efficient DevTest environments for some of their monolithic applications in a very traditional Microsoft stack software house.</p> <p>Our second talk is from Nicolas Corrarello of Hashicorp. He says \"The times, they are a changing. Generalised splat operators, GRPC, for loops. Join me on a quick tour of the new features of Terraform 0.12”</p> <p>Nicolas Corrarello's background includes 6+ years of Unix and Windows Server system administration roles, managing AIX/Solaris/Linux and different versions of Windows Server (2000 AS and above) systems in different companies. Nicolas also worked two years as a support engineer and instructor/examiner for Red Hat delivering RHCE/RHCA courses. As an open source enthusiast, he has more IT in his house than appliances. While he spent years doing things manually, he’s now a firm believer that the IT practice needs to evolve and rise to the challenges of current times. He's currently the Regional Director for Hashicorp’s Solutions Engineering team in Europe.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
