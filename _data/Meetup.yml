- name: The Clean Architecture by Ian Cooper
  description: "<p>Ian Cooper - The Clean Architecture</p> <p>What is 'the clean architecture' and how would you build one in .NET?</p> <p>Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures, including hexagonal architecture, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that, in the bulk of the presentation, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET.</p> <p>From first steps to working code, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core</p> <p>Twitter: @icooper</p> "

Alex has worked in IT, Marketing/Web design, Software Support and Software Delivery before moving into her current System Build (DevOps) role within TransUnion (formerly Callcredit). She spends her days making stuff better and says that a day without Metal and motor racing is a dull one.</p> <p>Alex has had rave reviewers from her 3 Ways of Devops talk at Leeds Testing Atelier and DevOpsDays London, using the idea of Gods, Reporters and Geniuses to spread the DevOps goodness to everyone. But tonight Alex will bring us her new talk \"Devoperability: Putting the Ops back into DevOps\" one we are very much looking forward to see.</p> <p>Our headline speaker sees the welcome return of Hannah Foxwell. Hannah is delivery manager at Pivotal, where she helps teams transform how they deliver software. A HumanOps champion, a HugOps evangelist, and a DevOps believer,</p> <p>Her Talk \"Reliability Engineering for Humans\" discusses how the concepts and practices of site reliability engineering are changing the way we build and operate our platforms, enabling us to have more meaningful conversations about availability, service-level objectives, and cost. But what are the benefits for the engineer holding the pager? Can we add a human element to our error budgets?</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch)</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

Are you into web development? JavaScript allows you to turn static websites into dynamic, engaging experiences for your visitors. Do you prefer to build more traditional applications, like desktop apps? JavaScript can do that and much more! Join us in this month's session to find out what this flexible language has to offer!<br/>* Introduction to Collaborative Coding and Open Source: discover how software is built out in the open, both by professionals and amateurs who want to share their craft with the world. Learn to harness the power of open source to develop your own software thanks to platforms like GitHub. Remember, don't reinvent the wheel!</p> <p>CodeUp is a learner-led meet-up for adults learning how to code. You tell us what you need support with, and we will do our best to help. With professional developers on hand, don't struggle alone. Let us help you develop your skills, for free!</p> <p>Whether you are a beginner with no prior programming knowledge, a hobbyist looking to get a job in tech or an experienced software engineer who wants to learn a new skill, we run a combination of workshops, talks and learner/mentor pairing to cater to aspiring developers of all levels.</p> <p>If you have a very specific question or problem, please comment with details so we can come prepared and provide the help you need.</p> <p>Remember to bring a laptop in order to participate in the session!</p> <p>You can find more information at <a href=\"https://codeupleeds.github.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeupleeds.github.io/</a> or join us on Slack using the following link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codeupleeds/shared_invite/enQtMzgyODEzODYwODIxLWY1MTZkOTc0MGQ0ZDlhNTkzYmI2YmIxMGJiYzdjZjI5Y2Q1ZTgyMTQyZmZmOTBiZDQzNWQ4NmJlNjc3ZjlhN2E\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codeupleeds/shared_invite/enQtMzgyODEzODYwODIxLWY1MTZkOTc0MGQ0ZDlhNTkzYmI2YmIxMGJiYzdjZjI5Y2Q1ZTgyMTQyZmZmOTBiZDQzNWQ4NmJlNjc3ZjlhN2E</a></p> <p>Space is limited, please only RSVP if you intend on coming.</p> "
