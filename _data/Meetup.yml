  description: '<p>Network, learn, ask a question, meet other folk, get fed - these are all things that happen at PASS user group events. These events are a really great opportunity to socialise in an informal learning experience.</p> <p>Remember to tell your friends and the people you work with; make sure you register as soon as you can.</p> <p>17.30 – 18:00 – Registration / networking.<br/>18:00 – 19:00 – Using Python in SSMS (Pete Moore)<br/>19:00 – 19:20 – Break (food / drinks).<br/>19:20 – 20:20 – Second talk (TBC)<br/>20:20 – 20:30 – Feedback (via Microsoft forms) then off t’pub.</p> <p>Using Python in SSMS<br/>Using Python from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio</p> <p>The noise started far away: you need to learn Python, it whispered. We ignored it for a while because we could. Besides we were busy, busy architecting databases, busy writing T-SQL and busy learning all of the other stuff on the MS Data Platform. Real data. Then something happened: you could code Python from within SSMS. The whisper had become deafening. This was now part of T-SQL coding. This was us.</p> <p>The Python had infiltrated our world, but what did it mean for us, the SQL folk? Did we need to up-skill? What now? Did we need new technology? Textbooks? New education?</p> <p>Or could we just ignore it? This decade’s LINQ (sorry LINQ folks)? This talk tackles these questions by coaxing Python out of its natural environment and debating the pros and cons of: SQL vs Python, Native Python vs Python in SSMS; and, ultimately, why we might just be able to have the best of both worlds - all from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio.</p> <p>About Pete Moore<br/>Pete is a Data Scientist specialising in R, Python, and SQL.
