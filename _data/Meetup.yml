- name: agileYork - Managing change in the 21st century + Greenfield vs Legacy Projects
  description: "<p>Managing change in the 21st century</p> <p>Nearly two decades into the 21st century and with nearly as much time passed since the Agile manifesto was written, what have we learned about change? Which is better: \"top down\", with the challenge of overcoming resistance to change, or \"bottom up\", perhaps never gathering momentum? Is it indeed a dichotomy, or can we find a third way for organizational transformation that is simultaneously respectful, ambitious, and sustainable? We'll explore a synthesis of ideas and techniques old and new, identifying along the way some widely-held beliefs that are now well past their sell-by date.</p> <p>Mike will be joining us the evening before delivering his Advanced Agendashift course (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4</a>) which tradition dictates is always launched first in Leeds. If you are interested in attending then Mike has offered members of agileYork a 15% discount, just enter SHARE15 when booking.</p> <p>About Mike Burrows</p> <p>Mike Burrows describes himself as a champion and enabler of outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation. He is the founder of Agendashift, author of two books – Kanban from the Inside (Blue Hole Press, 2014) and Agendashift (Leanpub, 2017) – and the originator of tools such as Featureban and 15-minute FOTO. Prior to his consulting career, Mike was a CTO for a late-stage startup and global Executive Director for a top-tier investment bank.</p> <p>Trials and Tribulations of Greenfield vs Legacy Projects</p> <p>I've spent a large chunk of my career working on greenfield projects, the promised land. All of the projects faced different issues, and we worked towards coming up with different solutions. The promised land wasn't all it's cracked up to be. Recently, I've spent a lot of time working on legacy projects, bringing them into the modern world. Again, these projects aren't perfect and presented a whole variety of different issues. Let's explore the types of projects, and decide which is better: Greenfield, or Legacy.</p> <p>Joe Stead</p> <p>The majority of my career has been dominated by the .NET world, although recently my focus has been on exploring the greater development community. I'm a firm believer in continually learning and trying new things, you never know what else is out there. Recently, I've focused on setting up a user group and developer community in Hull, HullDevs<br/>Twitter: @Joe_Stead<br/>Website: joestead.codes</p> "

Have you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?</p> <p>If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then the Cake ( <a href="http://cakebuild.net/" class="linkified">http://cakebuild.net/</a> ) Build Automation System is for you!In this session we will start with a standard .Net Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, using the C# skills that you may already have.</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park (@gep13 (<a href="https://twitter.com/gep13" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/gep13</a>))</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park has been developing on the .Net Platform for almost 10 years.

The internet is awash with malicious traffic and web applications are globally accessible. Don’t make it easy for them and the baddies will move on and find someone else to annoy.<br/>We’ll look at the risks facing web applications, the basic steps you can take so that you don’t make yourself a target and the things you should do to avoid becoming a data breach statistic. We’ll also look at lessons that can be learnt from mistakes that others have made.<br/>We’ll demo some of the techniques and tools in both attack and defence with examples for any web application developer.</p> '

- name: York Code Dojo February Meetup - Code Review
  description: "<p>For this York Code Dojo I'm planning on a doing a session based around some code reviewing. The idea is that I put up a piece of code on the screen and then you go away and discuss it (or re-write it) in pairs. After 5-10minutes we re-group and discuss it as a whole. We then move onto the next piece of code. I hoping to have a number of examples showing bad practice, bad algorithms, bad security, bad performance etc.. If anyone has any code they would like to contribute then that would be great. They can be a single method, class or program. Any mainstream language will be fine. This session will be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg\" /></p> "
