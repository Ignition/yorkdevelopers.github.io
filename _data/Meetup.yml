Typically e2e testing is deemed to be too expensive for smaller organisations and the team ends up having to rely on manual testing for the most part. Luckily modern open source tools are bridging this gap and make automated e2e testing possible for organisations of all sizes. I will talk about one popular e2e testing framework called Protractor. It has been developed by the Angular team but can be used for e2e testing any application. It is fully featured, stable and when combined with typescript can transform the e2e testing process into a productive and enjoyable activity.\"</p> <p>Katie Fenn - Securing your site like it's 1999<br/>\"Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named \"*~*Ninjad00d*~*\" who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.</p> <p>These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no recruitment policy.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"http://leedsjs.com/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedsjs.com/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "
