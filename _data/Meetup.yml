  description: "<p>Network, learn, ask a question, meet other folk, get fed - these are all things that happen at PASS user group events. These events are a really great opportunity to socialise in an informal learning experience.</p> <p>Remember to tell your friends and the people you work with; make sure you register as soon as you can.</p> <p>17.30 – 18:00 – Registration / networking.<br/>18:00 – 19:00 – Using Python in SSMS (Pete Moore)<br/>19:00 – 19:20 – Break (food / drinks).<br/>19:20 – 20:20 – Azure SQL DB migration readiness with Power BI (Steve Morgan)<br/>20:20 – 20:30 – Feedback (via Microsoft forms) then off t’pub.</p> <p>Using Python in SSMS<br/>Using Python from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio</p> <p>The noise started far away: you need to learn Python, it whispered. We ignored it for a while because we could. Besides we were busy, busy architecting databases, busy writing T-SQL and busy learning all of the other stuff on the MS Data Platform. Real data. Then something happened: you could code Python from within SSMS. The whisper had become deafening. This was now part of T-SQL coding. This was us.</p> <p>The Python had infiltrated our world, but what did it mean for us, the SQL folk? Did we need to up-skill? What now? Did we need new technology? Textbooks? New education?</p> <p>Or could we just ignore it? This decade’s LINQ (sorry LINQ folks)? This talk tackles these questions by coaxing Python out of its natural environment and debating the pros and cons of: SQL vs Python, Native Python vs Python in SSMS; and, ultimately, why we might just be able to have the best of both worlds - all from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio.</p> <p>About Pete Moore<br/>Pete is a Data Scientist specialising in R, Python, and SQL. He is the founder of Look at your Data Ltd and available for freelance work*, you can view his CV here: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/rvLhy1\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/rvLhy1</a></p> <p>Prior to Look at your Data, Pete was an IT Director.</p> <p>He is a present-day student at the Data Science MSc at the University of Dundee.<br/>*or permanent work, but it needs to be really, really good</p> <p>Azure SQL DB migration readiness with Power BI</p> <p>Working how ready your SQL estate is to migrate to one of the Azure SQL DB environments is a key decision point in the migration life cycle. In this session I'll be showing you how to use the Data Migration Assistant to interrogate your SQL estate and then present the results in a pre-built Power BI report.</p> <p>About Steve Morgan<br/>Steve Morgan has 20+ years’ experience as a data base engineer &amp; architect with the last 15 focused on Data Warehousing, BI &amp; Analytics. For a large part of that time he was an independent contractor working across many sectors and organisations usually in project recovery scenarios. In September 2017 he joined Microsoft as a Data Platform TSP (that’s Architect to you &amp; me) where he helps customers in the Health Care sector navigate the Microsoft Data Platform technologies both on-premise and in Azure.</p> "

  description: "<p>After our extended summer break we're back at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 23rd October for a night of Devops chatter:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Accelerating Delivery Velocity With Kubernetes<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Azure DevOps<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>Our first speaker is Simon Westcott a hands-on architect with 10+ yrs experience of building high traffic websites. In late 2016 Simon moved into the world of platform engineering to help re-imagine Sky Betting &amp; Gaming's delivery approach and drive operational efficiency. Delivery agility is key to Simon and his Team's success. As their engineering team grows, they have an increasing number of greenfield products to comission, as well as monolithic applications to decompose into microservices. To manage this they need a platform that can keep pace, both in the cloud and on-premise. Simon will explore with you why they choose Kubernetes, how they're adapting both on AWS and on-premise and the challenges they faced.</p> <p>Our headline talk is from Simon Thurman who is a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, he'll be showcasing Microsoft's latest toolchain, covering the components of the system such as pipelines, test plans, artifact repos, boards and more. Simon will demonstrate the steps involved and interactions as code moves from commit to production in Azure Devops.</p> <p>As an extra treat we'll also be giving away 2 tickets for the upcoming DevOpsDays Edinburgh conference on the 1st and 2nd of November.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
