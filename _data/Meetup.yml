- name: ACCU York [Jan 2019] - Option(al) Is Not A Failure
  description: "<p>We have the honor to welcome Phil Nash to ACCU York. Phil is the author of the C++ test framework, Catch2 and command line parser Clara. As Developer Advocate at JetBrains he's involved with CLion, AppCode and ReSharper C++. More generally he's an advocate for good testing practices, TDD and using the type system and functional techniques to reduce complexity and increase correctness. He's previously worked in Finance and Mobile as well as an independent consultant and coach specialising in TDD on iOS.</p> <p>Abstract: Error code returns were bad so we invented exceptions. Much better we said. Then we realised exceptions had their problems - with 52% of a recent ISO survey's respondents saying they were banned on all or part of their codebases! We've been trying to patch them up how we can (with noexcept, for example) - but most of the problems are systemic.</p> <p>So there's been a return to error codes. But now we have new features in the language (arithmetic data types, including variant and optional) - and the promise of more coming (expected, outcome?) - that bring us closer to the best of both worlds - although, perhaps, with different compromises.</p> <p>But there's more. Where do error_code and error_condition fit in? What's all this about monadic binding? A try keyword? What do other languages that are further down this road do and what can we learn from them?</p> <p>This talk will be a tour of the past, present, and possible future of C++ error handling; the trade-offs and rationale for each piece and a discussion of where to go next and what we can do as a community to get there. We'll look at a number of in-flight proposals, and include up-to-the-minute status on them following the most recent standards meeting.</p> "

  description: "<p>Ministry of Test Leeds is back for 2019 with a slightly new format.</p> <p>From the feedback we've had, people would like more meetings, but slightly shorter. Therefore we'll be trialing that for this month by having one main talk and one lightening talk.</p> <p>Going forward we'll be looking to see if this format works and if so, move to monthly meetings so more people can attend!</p> <p>To start the new way forward, we've got an excellent speaker lined up. Louise is very prominent within the Leeds community and highly experienced.</p> <p>They'll also be a lightening talk, food, drink, networking opportunities and lots of people to meet and talk to!</p> <p>6.30pm - 7pm: Networking and food</p> <p>7pm - 7.45pm: TALK: Test Driven Punishment - Louise Elliott (details below)</p> <p>7.45pm - 8pm: Break</p> <p>8pm - 8.15pm: Lightening talk - TBC</p> <p>Here are details for Louise and her talk:</p> <p>Louise Elliott (@IvanaTerrorBull)</p> <p>Louise has worked in the software world for longer than she cares to remember as a ​developer, technical architect and manager. She is passionate about pragmatic agile, quality, delivering value, cosmology, photography, visiting Antarctica (if only), roller derby, machine learning, bridge (the card game not things that help you cross rivers), people stuff, archery, war poetry and politics and she will talk endlessly about all of these given half the chance. She believes that people are infinitely fascinating and that managing people is like the most complex multivariable multithreaded system you ever encountered.</p> <p>About the Session</p> <p>What is the first thing we do when a major issue occurs in a live system? Sort it out of course. Then we start the hunt for the person to blame so that they can suffer the appropriate punishment. What do we do if a person is being awkward in the team and won’t agree to our ways of doing things? Ostracise them of course, and see how long it is until they hand in their notice – problem solved.</p> <p>This highly interactive talk delves into why humans have this tendency to blame and punish. It looks at real examples of punishment within the software world and the results which were achieved. These stories not only cover managers punishing team members but also punishment within teams and self-punishment. We are all guilty of some of the behaviours discussed.</p> "

  description: "<p>Happy new year, we've our first meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Thursday 24th January 2019:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:55 : TBC.<br/>8:55 - 8:10 : Intermission<br/>8:10 - 9:00 : The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>We're still dotting the i's and crossing the t's for our first speaker, but expect 30 mins filled with CI/CD, testing and the odd map! We'll update as soon as we have the everything sorted.</p> <p>Ahead of her appearence at Config Management Camp, Mihaela Drumeva (Micky for short) brings us a preview of her talk \"The Unexpected (Infrastructure Management) Journey\". Micky has a passion to automate all things. If she needs to perform a task more than twice, she'll automate it. Currently an operations engineer at Solarwinds, her 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams, from development to test, build and infrastructure. As well as her day job as an operations engineer her main area of interest is in enhancing and automating new and exiting processes to increase productivity, confidence and quality. She recently organised Devopsdays Edinburgh and is passionate about building strong and diverse tech communities.</p> <p>Micky will cover..</p> <p>- What is it like to start new in infrastructure management land coming from unconventional background?<br/>- How do you wrap your head into infrastructure as code when all you cared before was if your code compiles?<br/>- How do software development techniques translate to infrastructure management?</p> <p>Having started her first job as an operations engineer roughly 18 months ago, she had all of those questions and many more. Coming from development background the transition into a more ops role and a DevOps team has been a fascinating journey. She'd like to share the lessons she learned along the way and encourage more people to blur the traditional lines.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>As it's the start of a new year we've decided to expand the range of refreshments we offer, there will now be a wider range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
