Except it isn't. Code gives us the power to unleash our creative potential in new and interesting ways, whether that’s making interactive art, creating live music and visualisations, building games or even adding joyful flourishes on a web app.</p> <p>In this talk, I’ll show that our code doesn’t just have to be for building boring applications. Using real examples, I’ll talk about some ways that we can bring creativity into our coding projects, as well as ways for us to share our knowledge and why it’s important that we do. By the end, I hope to have inspired you to bring creativity into your projects and given you the enthusiasm to share your knowledge.</p> <p>Wade Penistone (@PenistoneWade) - Mindstack<br/>Bots, machine learning and AI are hot topics in the industry at the moment. The skillsets are in demand and there is plenty of resources for learning. Lots of people now also use voice assistants and helpdesk automated facilities.</p> <p>However developing for these is still a very vague and improvised strategy, with tools and frameworks only offering a limited scope and most of us as web developers unaware on the layers of compexity involved in creating an effective AI.</p> <p>Join me for what I believe is a solution to this problem, aimed at simplifying and consolidating the code needed in an nice and easy to use package/ecosystem.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>Providing decent monitoring of your applications has always been considered the boring part of development, with tons of boilerplate code, and making upfront decisions around how it will be done, or retrofit afterwards. However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it's never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production.</p> <p>In this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other.</p> <p>We’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate.</p> <p>We’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information. Finally, we'll look at Honeycomb.io and how they're providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production.</p> <p>Martin Thwaites<br/>VP Engineering @ MAG-O</p> <p>Martin is the VP of Engineering @ MAG-O, the Online arm of Manchester Airport Group.

The following presentation will delve into how MS PowerApps and the use of Flow can revolutionise one’s business processes - all of which are developed with the strength of the applications themselves to perform the heavy technical lifting, thus allowing IT teams to focus on enhancing the overall User Experience (UX).</p> <p>The discussion will focus on a real world example highlighting the business problems faced, the hurdles and complexities that were overcome and the overall solution that MS PowerPlatform provided to streamline the business and its operations.</p> <p>The talk will show the processing of taking a business process from data capture using a sophisticated MS PowerApp, a range of automation and background processes using the power of MS Flow and lastly the use of PowerBI to gain an understanding of the companies big data.</p> <p>Session Two : The State of Compliance and Records Management in SharePoint Online &amp; Office365 - Paul Gallagher (Independent Consultant)</p> <p>In this session, we will take a tour of the tools in SharePoint Online and Office 365 to help organisations develop and implement an information governance strategy across archiving, retention, disposition, supervision and records management and why your organisation might want to use them. We'll also look at some of the new cross-service functionality recently added to Office365 such as content search improvements, SEC17-a4 labels, Microsoft Information Protection and the File Plan tool that enables enterprises to define and maintain a File Plan in the Cloud and publish retention labels to the Advanced Data Governance Service in the Security and Compliance Center.</p> "
