After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no recruitment policy.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "
