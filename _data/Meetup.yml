  description: '<p>Front end development has never had so much attention as it does at the moment, but what if you could use your favourite back end language instead of having to task switch between different languages?</p> <p>Well, the folks that do JavaScript have been able to do that for a long time now, thanks to NodeJS, but now there’s something new on the scene, something that’s be growing quietly but slowly in the background, and you’ve probably heard all about it.</p> <p>It’s called “Web Assembly”, and it’s allowed many Language providers to start re-imagining how we might want to do front end development in the future.</p> <p>One very good case of this is “BLAZOR”, blazor is to put it simply “C# Programming that allows you to code directly in the browser”, you can now ditch Angular, React, Vue and all those complex JavaScript hooligans, and write your browser based applications directly in C# using the power of the .NET API.</p> <p>It’s still in very early stages, but making exceptionally good headway, so come join me for a 60 minute session and I’ll show you what’s happening and where we currently are with this fast moving target so far, this could change your view of browser programming for ever.</p> <p>Peter Shaw is a freelance developer / IT consultant, Pluralsight Author and General Manager of LIDNUG (the #1 users group for C# professionals on the internet)</p> '

  description: '<p>Until recently the only language we could use in web browsers was JavaScript. With the main four browsers now supporting WebAssembly we thought now would be a good time to take a look. The session will be suitable for people of any ability as most of us will be starting with no knowledge of WebAssembly :-) If possible please bring a laptop, ideally with the very latest version of Visual Studio 2019, or Visual Studio Code installed. (other editors can also be used) NOTE: Pizza and soft drinks will be provided :-) On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance. The venue is upstairs in the Fountains learning Centre, go into the library and either take the lift or stairs. It is normally well sign posted.

Working in the industry for over 20 years, focusing on Data tools such as SQL Server and AI technologies. Having worked as both a Premier Field Engineer and a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft Robin has a deep technical background in everything related to Data and AI.</p> <p>Azure Cloud Databases Roadmap and Discovery</p> <p>In this session we will discuss recent announcements and releases in the SQL Azure space. Including but not limited to Azure SQL Datawarehouse improvements; Azure SQL Database Hyperscale; Machine Learning Services in Azure SQL Database and Power BI; data masking strategies and pricing improvements. We will talk about why the services work the way they do and why you would use them in different architectures.</p> <p>** Simon Whitely (Adatis) **<br/>Bio:<br/>As Chief Architect with Adatis Consulting, Simon has been working with the Microsoft BI Stack for a decade, starting off building traditional warehouses with SSIS, SSRS and SSAS. He has since turned his head to the cloud and now spends his time advocating new methods of getting insight to the right people using Microsoft Azure’s advanced analytics platform. Whether it's automating file ingestion into Azure Data Lakes, applying massive compute via SQLDW &amp; Azure Databricks or orchestrating these pipelines via Data Factory, he can help.</p> <p>Simon is a strong advocate of the use of modern development practices in the data world (we actually are developers, whether we like it or not) and runs the Surrey Data Platform Group &amp; co-organises the London PASS Chapter.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Azure Databricks brings a PaaS offering of Apache Spark, which allows for blazing fast data processing, interactive querying and hosting of ML models all in one place!
