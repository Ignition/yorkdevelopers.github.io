Systems are now expected to be robust, resilient, responsive and scaleable in the face of varying workloads. Failure is not an option, downtime is not permitted.</p> <p>In the face of these requirements, developers in many different domains are independently discovering the same patterns for building systems. These patterns call for a different approach to building software where system components are flexible, scalable, loosely coupled.</p> <p>Approaches for developing systems with these attributes have existed for some time now, however, putting them all together we get Reactive System</p> <p>They will be some live code demos with Akka, RxJava, microservices and free food &amp; drinks.</p> <p><br/>Join us as we examine why we need Reactive Systems, discuss exactly what they are, investigate what benefits they offer and then show practical examples of Reactive Systems in action... all in a range of JVM languages</p> <p>Venue – Infinity Works</p> <p>Apsley House, 78 Wellington St, Leeds LS1 2EQ</p> <p><br/>Speakers</p> <p>Neil Dunlop – Principal Consultant at Infinity Works</p> <p>James Pittendreigh – Senior Java Developer at EE</p> <p>Ben Foster – Senior Consultant at Infinity Works</p> '

Testing is one of those areas that people often skip or forget about and it's great to have Colin join us to talk about it and it's importance</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Colin:</p> <p><i>\"Testing is important - it can improve the quality of your code and give you the reassurance to refactor without fear of destroying your application.</i></p> <p><i>My talk will cover different types of automated testing  in javascript (unit, integration, acceptance) and some regression as well tools to help standardise code (like js lint).</i></p> <p><i>I'll also talk about automated build tools like jenkins and travis ci.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we've got Lorna Mitchell (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lornajane\">@lornajane</a>) with a talk titled \"Fun with serverless Javascript\". Serverless is one of the areas of development which is growing and I'm really looking forward to hearing more about it!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Lorna:</p> <p><i>\"Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for JavaScripters of all levels.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
