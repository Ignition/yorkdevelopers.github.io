Typically e2e testing is deemed to be too expensive for smaller organisations and the team ends up having to rely on manual testing for the most part. Luckily modern open source tools are bridging this gap and make automated e2e testing possible for organisations of all sizes. I will talk about one popular e2e testing framework called Protractor. It has been developed by the Angular team but can be used for e2e testing any application. It is fully featured, stable and when combined with typescript can transform the e2e testing process into a productive and enjoyable activity.\"</p> <p>Katie Fenn - Securing your site like it's 1999<br/>\"Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named \"*~*Ninjad00d*~*\" who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.</p> <p>These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>A mini conference on all things relating to the Microsoft Data Platform plus we'll be serving up food with gravy (Yorkshire Puddings &amp; Chips etc.).</p> <p>09:30 | Registration<br/>10:00 | Introduction to Containers | Chris Taylor @sqlgeordie<br/>11:00 | Tune the query, not the plan | Kev Riley @kevriley<br/>12:00 | Lightning Talks<br/>13:00 | Lunch<br/>14:00 | Common issues from the field | Phil Grayson @databoffin<br/>14:30 | SQL Server Operations Studio | Martin Croft @martincroft<br/>15:15 | TBC | Dan Thompson @leedsdba<br/>16:00 | Pub</p> <p>10:00 | Introduction to Containers | Chris Taylor @sqlgeordie<br/>Session Details: Containers have been around for a while now but are becoming increasingly popular and with Microsoft’s release of Windows Server 2016, Docker is now their effective container standard. In this demo heavy session, we will run through what containers are, how to get started with Docker and “spinning up” SQL Server environments with minimal fuss and how you can adapt these or indeed your own VM images to create your own bespoke SQL Server development and testing environments.</p> <p>11:00 | Tune the query, not the plan | Kev Riley @kevriley<br/>Session Details: Execution plans are a great resource when trying to tune a query, but often we get hung up on trying to fix what we consider to be 'bad' operators, for example table scans vs clustered index scans; scans vs seeks; sort operations. In this session we will take a look at some misconceptions, step through what SQL Server is doing and see if we are actually improving the performance when change the plan to have 'better' operators.</p> <p>About Kevin: Kevan Riley (MCSE: Data Management and Analytics) has been working with SQL Server since 1999 in a variety of DBA and DB developer roles. He now works as a freelance SQL Server Consultant in the UK and is no more happier than when knee-deep in performance tuning. He can be often found contributing at ask.sqlservercentral.com and getting involved with the SQL community at UK user groups, SQL Saturdays, SQLBits and SQL Relay.</p> <p>12:00 | Lightning Talks</p> <p>13:00 | Lunch</p> <p>14:00 | Common issues from the field | Phil Grayson @databoffin</p> <p>14:30 | SQL Server Operations Studio | Martin Croft @martincroft</p> <p>Session Details: Anything that can make my job easier and make me more productive I am interested in. There are a lot of different tools out there for the data professional to make their life easier. Microsoft recently released in preview SQL Operations Studio, a cross-platform (Azure, Mac OS, Linux) open source platform for Developers and DBAs. Even in its infancy, it's on its had multiple releases, with new features added monthly this is starting to add things that are missing from likes of SSMS. I will cover what it offers, what you can do with it currently. The session will be demo-rich with information that might make your life easier ( at work)</p> <p>About Martin: Martin Croft is a time served SQL developer / DBA contractor / consultant who has worked with SQL Server since SQL 6.5 all the way through to SQL 2017, having attending the user groups for many years he wanted to (try) and give something back for all the things he's have picked up from the sessions he’s seen and share things people find useful (hopefully). Martin is a co-organiser of the Manchester SQL PASS Usergroup and SQLSaturday Manchester.</p> <p>15:15 | TBC | Dan Thompson @leedsdba</p> <p>16:00 | Pub choice will depend on the weather</p> "
