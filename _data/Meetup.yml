- name: LeedsDevops - February 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>Time for our second meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Monday 18th February 2019:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : The Case Against Microservices<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Habitat<br/>9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>Our first speaker of the evening is Aled Sage who is VP Engineering at Cloudsoft and co-founder of Apache Brooklyn. He spends his time helping customers migrate, run and evolve their applications in AWS; and developing the backend automation and processes to do this efficiently and reliably. He also helps big enterprise with devops and automation, particularly for disaster recovery and cloud-native. Aled has 20 years experience developing and managing distributed applications, mostly in the enterprise sector. Particular areas of interest include cloud, automation, devops, docker, fault tolerance and concurrency.</p> <p>His talk is about the case against microservices as he believes there are not enough talks out there about the downsides of microservices. Lots of people talk about how to do microservices right, some about the pitfalls and failures that we can learn from. But are microservices even the answer to your biggest painpoints, or will they inevitably increase the pain for you? This presentation covers why many companies should not even try to do microservices: highlighting simpler ways to get the \"benefits of microservices\", the downsides of microservices, and the risks they introduce. Finally, it covers the scenarios in which microservices are a good fit.</p> <p>We are delighted to have Adrian Daniels who is a Field Solutions Architect at Chef Software. Adrian says he thrives on helping people to use and understand technology so that they can be more efficient and produce higher quality software.</p> <p>Adrian will be talking about Habitat, an open-source project by Chef that enables you to ship your application, to any platform, along with all the automation you'll need to manage it in production. In this talk, he'll look at creating the habitat plan, building packages, exporting to common container platforms, and running the habitat packages in their own process management supervisor. You'll learn the steps to create repeatable, portable application environments for your applications from a clean room environment to running them in production. There will be plenty of examples of how its been used by customers.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>As it's the start of a new year we've decided to expand the range of refreshments we offer, there will now be a wider range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
