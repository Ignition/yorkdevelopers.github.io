  description: "<p>This month, Adam Hodgen will be introducing us to <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\">Rust</a>, a 'blazingly fast systems programming language that prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety'.  While best-known for its safe memory management using pointer ownership, it has some other interesting features such as pattern matching and type inference.</p> <p>As usual this will be a practical session, so check out the <a href=\"http://leedscodedojo.github.io/\">LCD website</a> for details on installing Rust and other info.  Don't worry if you don't have a laptop, we'll pair you up with someone that does.</p> <p>This will be long-time LCD'er Adam's last session before moving to Ireland, so try and get down here and wish him well in true LCD style - over pizza and code!</p> "

We'll then split into smaller groups to work on the issues and just see how it pans out.</p> <p>Since we'll having laptops around (feel free to bring your own) why not also show us what you're proud of or bring along an issue that's currently making you scratch your head, we'll try to help!</p> "

After a few years in the administrative wilderness, she completed a Masters in Aerospace Engineering, before becoming a Spacecraft Thermal Engineer.
