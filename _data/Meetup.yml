  description: "<p>Hot on the heels of the April meetup, we've organised some great speakers for May. The theme for May will be more technical and automation based.</p> <p>6pm - 6.30pm: Networking and food</p> <p>6.30pm - 7.15pm: TALK: Testing Kafka - Lessons learned testing a Kafka based application with Jest and NodeJS - Colin Wren (@colinwren)</p> <p>7.15pm - 7.30pm: Break</p> <p>7.30pm - 8.15pm: Where we’re going, we don’t need roads - Scott Kenyon (@Testing_Scott)</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Here are the speaker and talk details:</p> <p>COLIN WREN:<br/>Having been a developer for 8 years, Colin jumped over that fence developers love to chuck work over six months ago to became an SDET with interests in automation, the visualisation of test report data and value driven development practices. Outside of work Colin loves augmented reality, Pokemon Go (for which he helps run the Leeds community), death metal and board games.</p> <p>Testing Kafka:<br/>Having spent the last 6 months testing a Kafka based application, Colin gives a short introduction to what Kafka is, how it’s used and shares his experience of writing an end-to-end test framework using Jest and NodeJS.</p> <p>SCOTT KENYON:<br/>Scott is at the start of his testing journey having become a full time tester in August 2018. Coming from an analytical and technical support background he is very inquisitive and always willing to help others. He has embraced the testing mind-set and mythology having been thrown in at the deep end by his mentor Ady Stokes (don’t worry he had arm bands). Quickly developing a passion for testing he also takes part in triathlons and is married with 2 children. A strong believer that diversity in testers is a key benefit he is open about his own autism and anxiety disorder, talking to others about it openly. Currently works as a Test Analyst for Computershare in Skipton North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads:<br/>From the very start my eyes were opened to the testing universe and all the weird and wonderful ways that we can exam software. This lightening talk will share Scott’s journey from the past to the most recent 7 months. How he has evolved and adapted to fit into his own way of testing. He will also share the internal conflict he went through to understand “am I adding enough value?”</p> <p>Thank you to our hosts Infinity Works and our sponsors Fruition IT, FDM Group and Computershare.</p> "
