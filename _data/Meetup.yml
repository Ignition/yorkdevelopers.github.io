Teams will experience first-hand how Conway's Law plays out in a series of examples.</p> <p>The question remains \"How will you adapt?\"</p> <p>Agenda for the evening:</p> <p>● 18:30 - Networking, food and drinks<br/>● 19:00 - Talk<br/>● 20:15 - More networking and drinks<br/>● 20:30 - Departure</p> <p>About Tony</p> <p>Tony Richards is an Agile Coach working on large scale Agile Transformations.

- name: LeedsDevops - May 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>Spring is well and truly here and on Tuesday 21st May 2019 so are we at the ODI Node in Leeds for fresh devops thoughts.</p> <p>* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>* 7:25 - 8:05 : Non Toxic Work Environments<br/>* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>* 8:20 - 9:00 : Serverless Chaos<br/>* 9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>We start this meetup with a different knid of talk, as we know a large part of devops is about creating a culture of trust, callaboration and empathy with our fellow colleagues. Alex Stanhope – Cloud Architect &amp; DevOps Consultant from Lightenna in our first talk of the evening \"Non Toxic Work Environments\" describes that stress can be a fantastic healthy way to experience new challenges, grow and learn but without the right context, support and respite it can do real harm. In this session he'll look at the things we can all do to keep our workplaces happy and productive.</p> <p>Our second talk of the night is a duo from DAZN, Mick Roper and Tom Lloyd. Mick is a Software engineer and architect with 10 years experience. Worked in businesses of all shapes and sizes and is the un-crowned king of the summer bbq. Tom is a engineer at Dazn with a background in functional Scala microservices and modular React apps. He has previously worked for Sky on their Sky Mobile launch, as well as their identity services. In his spare time, you’ll often find him on a mountain or watching old films.</p> <p>Their talk \"Serverless Chaos\" discusses how chaos engineering is becoming a core competency required by teams to ensure that their users get the best experience of the product, but how do you apply chaos engineering approaches to Serverless architecture? In this talk they will explain the problem and demonstrate the solution to Serverless Chaos.</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new atendees to make friends with other first time atendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - big thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an [anti harassment policy and code of conduct] (<a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct</a>) in order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

  description: "<p>Hot on the heels of the April meetup, we've organised some great speakers for May. The theme for May will be more technical and automation based.</p> <p>6pm - 6.30pm: Networking and food</p> <p>6.30pm - 7.15pm: TALK: Testing Kafka - Lessons learned testing a Kafka based application with Jest and NodeJS - Colin Wren (@colinwren)</p> <p>7.15pm - 7.30pm: Break</p> <p>7.30pm - 8.15pm: Where we’re going, we don’t need roads - Scott Kenyon (@Testing_Scott)</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Here are the speaker and talk details:</p> <p>COLIN WREN:<br/>Having been a developer for 8 years, Colin jumped over that fence developers love to chuck work over six months ago to became an SDET with interests in automation, the visualisation of test report data and value driven development practices. Outside of work Colin loves augmented reality, Pokemon Go (for which he helps run the Leeds community), death metal and board games.</p> <p>Testing Kafka:<br/>Having spent the last 6 months testing a Kafka based application, Colin gives a short introduction to what Kafka is, how it’s used and shares his experience of writing an end-to-end test framework using Jest and NodeJS.</p> <p>SCOTT KENYON:<br/>Scott is at the start of his testing journey having become a full time tester in August 2018. Coming from an analytical and technical support background he is very inquisitive and always willing to help others. He has embraced the testing mind-set and mythology having been thrown in at the deep end by his mentor Ady Stokes (don’t worry he had arm bands). Quickly developing a passion for testing he also takes part in triathlons and is married with 2 children. A strong believer that diversity in testers is a key benefit he is open about his own autism and anxiety disorder, talking to others about it openly. Currently works as a Test Analyst for Computershare in Skipton North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads:<br/>From the very start my eyes were opened to the testing universe and all the weird and wonderful ways that we can exam software. This lightening talk will share Scott’s journey from the past to the most recent 7 months. How he has evolved and adapted to fit into his own way of testing. He will also share the internal conflict he went through to understand “am I adding enough value?”</p> <p>Thank you to our hosts Infinity Works and our sponsors Fruition IT, FDM Group and Computershare.</p> "
