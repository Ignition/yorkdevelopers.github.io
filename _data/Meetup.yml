  description: "<p>Join us for fun with Raspberry Pis in the labs of York St. John Computer Science department. In this month's Code Dojo we will construct a fibre-optic communication system using two Raspberry Pis, some LEDs and some high-performance optical coupling paste (blu-tack) and investigate how to send messages from one board to the other using only visible light.</p> <p>We will write code in Python, Javascript or C and look at the best (or maybe worst) ways to encode information into photons.</p> <p><i>The session will be led by Carl Hetherington. Carl is an electronic engineer and programmer working as a technician and lecturer on the Computer Science programme at York St. John University. In his spare time Carl contributes to open-source projects; in the past these have included inkscape.org (vector graphics editor) and ardour.org (digital audio workstation). Carl wrote and now maintains dcpomatic.com, the easiest (and cheapest) way to create content files for professional digital cinema systems. </i></p> "
