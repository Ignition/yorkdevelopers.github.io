- name: Recent excavations at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr
  description: "<strong>Professor Nicky Milner, Deputy Head of Department, Department of Archaeology, University of York<br />\n</strong><br />\nStar Carr is an internationally important Mesolithic site that dates back to roughly 9000 BC. First discovered and excavated in the 1940s it unearthed some extremely rare and intriguing objects, such as headdresses made from red deer skulls and amber beads, which had been preserved in the peat for millennia. The rarity of such objects made the site famous in the archaeological world and many different interpretations were made as to what sort of site it was: e.g. base camp, hunting camp, tanning site, or kill site. From 2004-2015 further excavations took place led by a team from the Universities of York, Manchester and Chester. Although severe deterioration of the deposits had taken place, other rare discoveries were made including more headdresses and an engraved pendant. In addition, three large wooden platforms were uncovered representing the oldest evidence of carpentry in Europe. These important findings have changed the ways in which we understand how hunter-gatherers lived, shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. "
