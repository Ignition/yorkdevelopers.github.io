  description: For a number of years, YPS members have been helping to celebrate the achievements of a number of Yorkshire sixth formers. As part of a scheme sponsored by the Nuffield organisation, these young people spend their summer taking part in scientific research under the guidance of professional scientists in local universities and businesses. At the end of the project, they prepare posters explaining their work. On October 17<sup>th</sup>, at a reception held before our regular lecture, members of the YPS will be invited to view these, and talk to the young people about their experiences.
