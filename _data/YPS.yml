- name: George Cayley 250th Anniversary Symposium
  description: George Cayley was born in Scarborough on 27th December 1773 and has been called both the &#8220;Father of the Aeroplane&#8221; and the &#8220;Father of Aerodynamics&#8221;. As a school boy he began his study of flight by observing birds and created a prototype helicopter. But unlike many inventors before him, Cayley quickly rejected the notion that an airship required flapping wings. He saw that seagulls changed the angle and shape of their wings to stay aloft, and realised that a man-made glider could do the same. In 1799 Cayley engraved a design for a manned glider on one side of a small silver disc. On the other side, he diagrammed the forces applied to flight. He continued to refine his invention off and on over the years and in 1853 he persuaded his coachman, John Appleby, to sit in this new machine, which then flew 900ft across Brompton Dale.  The legend is that John, aged 79, gave his notice with the words &#8220;I was hired to drive not to fly&#8221;.
