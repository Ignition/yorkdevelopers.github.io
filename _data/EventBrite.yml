    Speaker: Dr Annie Hodgson, Department of Chemistry

    Department of Chemistry Open Lecture

    Some of the most amazing scientific discoveries have been made completely by accident. The sign of a great scientist is that they recognise the significance of what they observe; then led by curiosity and imagination experiment to develop an idea or invention. Whether the accident is the result of a clumsy cat or a careless chemist, serendipity has played an important role in the history of science. Dr Annie Hodgson will take you into the world of serendipitous discoveries and will try to recreate some of these accidents on purpose!

  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Clive Lipchin, Arava Institute, Israel

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    The Middle East is one of the world’s most water scarce regions, but also has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. That means water demand is fast outstripping supply and climate change impacts will only exacerbate the issue. Despite this dire reality, Israel today has a water surplus, and has successfully decoupled itself from the vagaries of diminishing freshwater supplies.

    In this presentation Dr Lipchin will discuss how Israel went from a water scarce to a water abundant country. He will discuss the implementation of successful technologies, the government policies and economics that encourage the adoption of a water smart country, and a culture that encourages and supports innovation and conservation. He will also discuss how Israel can leverage its water abundance for regional cooperation and stability.

- name: Should we be worried about indoor air pollution?
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Nic Carslaw, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    In developed countries, we have been estimated to spend about 90% of our time indoors, for instance at home, at work, or commuting between the two. It therefore follows that our exposure to air pollution, whether to pollutants generated indoors or outdoors, happens mainly in the indoor environment. This presentation will introduce the audience to the many ways in which we can be exposed to air pollution indoors, including through activities such as cooking or cleaning. The presentation will finish with some methods for reducing our exposure to pollution indoors as well as some to avoid, along with some thoughts on future issues for indoor air quality.

  description: >
    ***This event is free for all students and staff from the University of York and University of York St John; email enterprise@york.ac.uk for the discount code***




    Want to make a video game? 

    Learn how by joining the York Game Jam as part of Global Game Jam 2019! Bring along your friends and make a game together, or come and meet new friends.


    How does it work?

    You'll be set a theme for the game on the Friday evening (25th January). Then, over the course of 48 hours you and your fellow team mates will rapidly go through each stage of game development in crunchtime fashion. This covers everything from theme development through to music, artwork and programming. When the deadline hits you will have a fully playable game!

    Industry experts will be coming along on both the Saturday and Sunday to play your games and give you hints and advice!


    No code experience? No problem.

    Whether you're an industry veteran or a total beginner, anyone is welcome to try their hand at making a game – no code experience is required (although having computer skills helps, and we're sure you've got those!).


    ***Introductory workshop***


    In preparation for the Game Jam, we will be running workshops to help you learn how to make a game. More details will be announced soon.



    What do I need to bring?

    Bring your laptops, your friends and your curiosity. Don't forget to bring refreshments to keep up your energy levels, bearing in mind, though, that you're not in any way expected to work through the night. Sleep is a beautiful thing.

    We recommend that you download the software you'd like to use in advance of the Game Jam so you're ready to go. If you're not sure of what you’ll need, see the suggestions on the Game Jam website.


    Sounds fun?

    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of September 2018, confirmed speakers will explore areas such as gene therapy, scientific policy making and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

     

    FAQ:


    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. 

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Facebook: facebook.com/YorkScienceConference --> Feel free to message us, we respond rapidly!

- name: Towards Sustainable Plastics
  description: >
    A free symposium on the challenges and solutions to the global issue of plastic waste pollution

    Over recent years, there has been significant attention drawn towards the environmental damage caused by traditional plastics. This global pollution issue has arisen from several factors including complications surrounding the direct reuse of consumer packaging, challenges associated with chemical recycling and subsequent separation of plastic additives, the chemical composition of commonly used plastics, together with many socio-economic and infrastructure issues. Due to diversity of these key problems, a multitiered approach, utilising different expertise is needed to challenge the problem of plastic waste holistically.

    Why attend?


    Build knowledge and bridge the different technical areas (from polymer design to additives extraction and recycling)

    Forge new relationships in the field of sustainable plastics in our networking sessions

    Discuss potential sources for funding important research over the next few years, such as the forthcoming ISCF Wave 3

- name: IDGC-YCCSA Seminar:Information Transforming Human Network Systems to a Sustainable Nexus Multiplex
  description: >-
    The Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre and York Cross-Disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis are pleased to present a seminar by Dr. Roger Cremades from the Climate Service Centre, Germany.

    IGDC Research Seminar Series: Exploring sustainability, resilience, security and complexity within the water-energy-land-food nexus.

    Abstract:Separate considerations of water, energy, food and land use pressures and environmental constraints result in a waste of resources and incoherent planning worldwide. Current modelling of these pressures as an integrated nexus captures limited instances of a more complex feature: the distribution and trade networks formed by each of these nexus elements. Together these form a ‘multiplex’ that has not been studied previously as a whole. Moreover, the sustainability properties of these multiplexes and their implications for development are not understood. Using big data techniques to assimilate real-world water, energy, commodities’ trade and transport networks, and graph theory and complex systems science to analyse and model them, the seminar will explore how to (i) analyse their emerging complex properties, (ii) understand which of these properties lead to sustainability, (iii) test these properties and study their full potential in transformation simulation models to better understand and enhance sustainability, resilience and security, and (iv) formulate a new data-driven theoretical paradigm that studies sustainability from a systemic multiplex perspective. This project will lay the groundwork for new approaches to evaluating sustainability and development using the latest advances in big data and complex systems.  

    Freshements will be available after the talk followed by a discussion session.
