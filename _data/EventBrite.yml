- name: How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help those living with Parkinson’s
  description: >-
    Speaker(s):  Professor Stephen Smith, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are influencing our everyday lives - finding the quickest route home, predicting what we might want to buy and even finding us the perfect partner - but can it also help those living with Parkinson’s?  Parkinson’s is a devastating condition that affects 1 in 100 of those over 60 and currently has no cure. It costs the UK over £2 billion per annum and numbers are set to rise as we all live longer.

    In this lecture we will see how evolutionary algorithms, a form of machine learning, can help diagnose and monitor Parkinson’s, assist in the prescription of medication, and find new drugs to slow or even halt this debilitating condition.

    This talk will be preceded by a drinks reception in P/T/005A in the Exhibition Centre at 5.30pm  - open to all ticketholders.

- name: First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Rail Competition Briefing - York
  description: "“Demonstrating tomorrow’s stations and a greener railway” \r\nOpens 8 October 2018 \r\nDo you have an innovative product and service that is ready for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?\r\nOr are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling stock, infrastructure or stations?\r\nIf so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the first time in real-world rail environments.”\r\nThe themes for this FoaK2 competition are:\r\n\r\nDecarbonising the railways: Decarbonisation is a priority across the network, including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies, energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies, novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.\r\nCustomer experience in stations: This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision of the ‘station of the future’.\r\n\r\nInnovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness and integration into the railway system.\r\nFoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.\r\nInnovations for this competition must be:\r\n\r\nHigh TRL proven technologies – i.e. market ready\r\nVery low technology risk\r\nThe focus will be on: Integration activities; Demonstration proof of concept to customers and end-users; Collecting feedback from customers and users; Real innovations in the real world\r\n\r\nBusinesses can apply for a share of a substantial pot of money for First of a Kind technology to demonstrate aspects of tomorrow’s railway today. This competition offers the potential of 100% funding, with projects starting in early 2019.\r\nNot able to attend? There will also be briefings in London (11th October), where the scope and competition process presentations will also be available via webcast, and Cardiff (17th October).\r\n "

    "The Global Problem of Pharmaceutical Pollution" with Professor Alistair Boxall

    We will probably all use pharmaceuticals at some stage in our life. Following use, pharmaceuticals are excreted into the sewage system and can then pass through sewage treatment plants into surface waters. Pharmaceuticals can also be released during the manufacturing process or as a result of disposal of unused medicines. 

    As pharmaceuticals are biologically active molecules, in recent years there has been increasing interest from scientists and the general public over the potential impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms and on humans that consume drinking water containing pharmaceuticals.

    In this talk, Alistair will describe the work he is doing in York to understand the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments across the globe and the implications for ecological and human health. Solutions to minimise the impacts of pharmaceuticals on the environment will also be presented.

     

    Alistair Boxall is Professor in Environmental Science in the University of York’s Environment and Geography Department. His research focuses on understanding emerging and future ecological and health risks posed by chemical contaminants in the natural environment. 

    Alistair is a past member of the Defra Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances and past Chair of the Pharmaceutical Advisory Group of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. He regularly advises national and international organisations on issues relating to chemical impacts on the environment and has published extensively on his field.

    Alistair has coordinated major European projects and is Director of the York City Environment Observatory Initiative. He received the 2016 Recipharm International Environmental Award for his work on the impacts of chemical contaminants on the environment.

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers
