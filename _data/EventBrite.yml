- name: 'Alex Bellos: The World’s Favourite Number'
  description: >-
    Maths writer Alex Bellos was so sick of being asked for his favourite number that he started to ask everyone else the same question. More than 40,000 responses later he had a treasure trove of data. In a talk that includes mathematics, psychology and the history of science, Bellos reveals the curious patterns behind our emotional responses to numbers - what they say about us, and what’s important about them.

    About the Author

    Speaker: Professor Damian Murphy, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    The creative industries in the UK make up a significant part of our economy and can be rightly considered a global success. Working together across the arts, science and engineering is fundamentally important for our creative sector to maintain this position. New immersive and interactive creative technologies bring emerging challenges and opportunities for both our content creators, and the engineers and technologists behind the systems used to author this content, as audiences adapt and change to how they demand and consume their digital media.

    The audio industry has, for many years, successfully brought together the arts, science and engineering, established through a common language, appreciation and understanding of music, and its creation, capture, storage, manipulation and delivery across many different forms. Professor Damian Murphy will explore research that has emerged from the Department of Electronic Engineering AudioLab, as part of more than thirty years of the University of York’s contribution to the shape and definition of this multi-disciplinary field. From the creation of virtual sound environments to the impact of sound on our environment; through listening to the past to telling stories in new ways for next generation audiences – what might our future sound like?

    There will be a drinks reception in the Treehouse from 5.30pm to 6.30pm for ticket holders. 

    Professor Damian Murphy

    Damian Murphy is Professor in Sound and Music Computing at the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York, where he has been a member of academic staff since 2000, and is the University Research Theme Champion for Creativity. He started his career in the Performing Arts Department at Harrogate College and has previously held positions at Leeds Metropolitan University and Bretton Hall College. His research focuses on virtual acoustics and he has published over 130 journal articles, conference papers and books in the area. He is a member of the Audio Engineering Society, a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and a visiting lecturer to the Department of Speech, Music and Hearing at KTH, Stockholm. Prof. Murphy is also an active sound artist and the Director of the newly launched £15m XRStories R&D Partnership exploring interactive and immersive storytelling for the UK’s creative screen industries.

    Speakers: Susan Halfpenny and Stephanie Jesper, Information Services

    Information Services Lecture

    Once upon a time, there was a world before our own: a land where the internet didn’t exist. It was a magical place... of playing outdoors, looking up information in books, visiting the library! An age when you didn’t know everybody’s bad opinions on every topic; where meeting people actually involved going to a physical place! That fabled land is a fading memory. Now it’s hard to go a day without using digital technologies.

    In this new and confusing world, we can barely tell fact from fairytale. Trolls no-longer simply hide under bridges, while big bad wolves keep their big big eyes on us, recording our every action. Has something got lost in this digital forest? Have we traded the prospect of a happy ending for a handful of magic beans?

    In our digital age the ability to effectively use, manipulate and produce digital content is fast becoming a requirement for participation in social, economic and political activities. It is therefore essential to develop the skills for this engagement: to become “digital citizens”.

    In this lecture we explore opportunities and challenges presented by digital services and technologies: how have our perceptions of public and private changed? What is the impact on our security and freedom? Does technology present a threat to our democracy or open us to a global community of information-sharing and collaboration? Join us as we travel the utopian and dystopian landscapes of the digital world in search of the answer to how we might all become empowered digital citizens.

- name: Clean Air Day- air pollution and York
  description: "Air pollution, its all over the news and all over our cities, but what do you really want to know about it?  Come along to find out about air quality research at the University of York, how it relates to this beautiful city and where it impacts on our everyday lives. Take the opportunity to quiz experts from the University and York City Council on all things air pollution, and consider the simple things that can be done to help improve the air we breathe.\nHosted by the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York, this event aims to raise awareness of air pollution issues - particularly in York - ahead of Clean Air Day (20th June), the UK’s largest air pollution campaign.\nAbout the speakers\nDr David Carslaw is a Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York. His research is focussed on developing a better understanding of urban air pollution, particularly around emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Much of his work is aimed at better quantifying vehicle emissions under urban driving conditions. Another area of focus is the development of receptor modelling approaches to improve understanding of the influence of different emission sources on ambient concentrations. \nAlastair Lewis is Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York working within the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories. He is also currently Deputy Director of, and Director for atmospheric composition, at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). He has participated in over 30 major atmospheric science field projects, from polar regions to tropical oceans, city centres to remote forests. He is a member of a number of expert advisory groups including for Defra, the World Meteorological Organisation and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nLiz Bates is a University of York alumni employed as a specialist air quality officer at City of York Council and City of Bradford MDC. She helped develop the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) and Low Emission Strategy (LES) for York and has a specialist interest in low emission planning. She helps to co-ordinate Clean Air Day activities in York.\nHealth in Urban Environments Event Series\nThe event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.\nThrough a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.\nBy bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.\nThe series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York."

- name: 'Sustainability Metrics: Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II'
  description: >-
    Measure and monitor your supply chain’s performance with appropriate and easy-to-use sustainability metrics. Existing industrial sustainability metrics primarily focus on the chemical process, although the need to consider the performance of a “bigger picture” is prevalent and growing. This workshop is dedicated to demonstrating current trends and practices in applying qualitative and quantitative sustainability evaluation practices, through use of LCA and other industrial best procedures.

    Context There is a current need for innovative business models that are sustainable and resource efficient to meet with fast-approaching and stricter environmental targets. Reducing, neutralising or going negative with carbon emissions in any process is a challenge, regardless of the sector. Creating a circular economy could be the ideal solution to overcome this challenge. Undertaking these responsibilities to the highest accuracy, extensiveness of this reporting and transparency among stakeholders are currently some of the major hurdles. Some enterprises have, however, been successful. With a view to creating a dialogue and awareness of the various methods of tracking and reporting these sustainability characteristics, in portfolio management, systems thinking to end of life management strategies, the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence is organising a “Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II” event.

- name: Impacts of extreme climatic events on ecosystems
  description: "Extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves, floods and fires can have profound effects on ecosystems and biodiversity. Projections indicate that climate change is likely to increase the incidence and / or magnitude of such extreme events in many places. The summer of 2018 was remarkable for hot, dry weather in many areas of the world and for a large number of wildfires. \nThis two-day conference on the ecological consequences of extreme climatic events will 1) present recent results, 2) provide a forum for discussion and 3) explore options to build resilience of ecosystems. The conference will consist of a mixture of invited and offered papers, with opportunities for discussion. We envisage the audience will largely be composed of researchers, with a smaller number of conservation practitioners / policy makers, with attendees from Europe and elsewhere, as well as the UK. The event will help to synthesise recent findings in an important area of science with application to real world problems, with the potential for attendees to contribute to a publication and/or special issue in this area. \nAcross the two days, we will have four sessions of scientific presentations, with two invited speakers (tbc) per session, and discussion after each. The first evening will be an informal dinner with a poster session. \n1. Quantifying extreme events – frequency & severity \n2. Impacts of extreme events on biodiversity (to include extreme versus long-term changes)\n3. Impacts of extreme events on different ecosystems, local versus global impacts\n4. Policy recommendations & adaptation/management for extreme events \n15-minute talks and posters are welcomed on any of the above topics. This meeting will take a broad approach and monitoring, modelling and experimental studies are all welcomed."
