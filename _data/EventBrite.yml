- name: Summer 2018 Planetarium Shows
  description: >+
    Join us for our free weekly planetarium shows! 40 of our 60 seats are reservable for every show.  Reserve seats at noon on the Sunday prior to a show. Reserved seats get claimed quickly, but we always have 20 walk in seats available too!

    Join us for our free public planetarium show!

    Come and learn about the current night sky and see a fulldome movie! Our Friday night shows are geared towards a general audience and last about 75 minutes. The Wayne State University planetarium has a Spitz high definition digital projector and seating for 60 guests.

    Show Dates and Times

    Shows are held at 7pm and 8:30pm every Friday from May 11th through the end of July.

    Ticket Availability

    40 seats will be available for reservation on Eventbrite at noon on the Sunday prior to a show. The remaining 20 seats will be available first-come first-serve at the door for walk-ins. If you reserve a seat please arrive with your ticket no later than 10 minutes before the show starts. We will release remaining open seats to the general public after this time. Due to the dome-shaped ceiling we are truly limited in how many people can see the show.

    Parking Information

    The nearest WSU campus lot with visitor parking is lot 60; if you prefer a WSU parking garage, both garage 6 and 8 have visitor parking. See http://parking.wayne.edu/visitors/index.php for maps and fees.

    On street parking is also available, the city charges $1.00 per hour and takes cash, credit cards, or you can use their mobile app ParkDetroit on your phone for payment.

    Finding the Planetarium on Wayne State University's Campus

    The planetarium is located on the lower lever of the Old Main building - the building with the clock tower on the corner of Cass and Warred Avenues in Detroit. If you enter through the main entrance on Cass Avenue, take the stairs down and walk straight ahead - you'll see the Planetarium murals and our double doors - room 0209.

    For Families

    On the second Saturday morning each month the planetarium offers a free show geared towards families with children 10 and under, our Young Astronomer's Show. While children are welcome at Friday night shows, they may prefer the Young Astronomer's Show content. These shows last just about an hour,  have a movie geared towards children, and may be best for young children who have trouble sitting quietly through a longer, more complex presentation. 

    Interested in bringing a large group to the planetarium?

    The planetarium can be reserved for private showings for school groups, scout troops, birthday parties or by other organizations for a fee. Please contact our staff for more information so we can help you design a show to meet your needs.

    The Planetarium will be closed to the public during the month of August, and will reopen to the public on Friday September 7th.

    For additional information on location or event details please see the planetarium website.

When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!

    ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS FOUNDATION

    Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 17.5 million deaths each year. Cardiovascular disease may strike those in their prime years and, due to population aging, also afflict elderly people who are otherwise living healthy lives. Improvements in cardiovascular therapy have markedly reduced procedural risk, and thereby enabled the treatment of a broad range of patients, more than ever before in the history of medicine. Nonetheless, significant disparities in the delivery of cardiovascular care continue to exist, leading to large unmet clinical needs for many patients worldwide. Innovation in the delivery of cardiovascular care, as well as education of the public at-large, is essential for optimizing the management of these patients.


    The Cardiovascular Innovations Foundation is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    The mission of the Foundation is to address unmet needs in cardiovascular care through the study, design, and development of innovative health care solutions and education of health care providers and the larger public.

  description: "The Austin Forum on Technology & Society\nin partnership with Austin Public Library \npresents\nBlockchain: Bringing the Transformation Home\nwith Jeremy Drzal, Block512 and Karen Kilroy, Kilroy Blockchain \nTuesday, July 10, 2018\nAustin Central Library - Event Center\n710 W Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX 787015:45 p.m. – Doors Open6:15 p.m. – Presentation, Q&A7:30 p.m. – Networking \nWhat is blockchain? Why has it emerged as a potentially disruptive solution for so many applications? How will it transform business, government, and society? How can/will Austin support, accelerate, and even lead this transformation?\nBlockchain is a technology that promises utterly secure transactions of all types. It is widely known as the foundation for bitcoin and now for many other digital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, but this is just one important application. Blockchain is a distributed computing technology founded on principles of security, transparency, and permanence, and has potential to increase usability and immutability of all kinds of records and peer-to-peer transactions, from health records to property ownership to distributed IoT applications and prevention/detection of contaminated or counterfeited physical goods—and more. It can accomplish such things while preventing unauthorized usage, corruption of information, and theft of assets. \nBut, what exactly is it, and how does it provide simplicity, enable security, remove ‘middlemen,’ and ultimately promise a more transparent-but-secure, peer-to-peer method of transactions with permanent records? Come hear blockchain experts Jeremy Drzal and Karen Kilroy explain all this and more, and learn how Austin can be a leader in the blockchain revolution. \nWe welcome your participation! Please send us your questions, answers and prognostications in advance at info@austinforum.org.\nAdmission to the Austin Forum is always free.\nThe Austin Forum accepts donations of used cell phones and smart phones at all our events. All devices will have a factory reset and be set up as new by the team at Austin Pathways’ nationally-recognized “Unlocking the Connection” initiative, which will connect every public housing resident with a digital device, digital literacy training, and a free or very low-cost internet connection. Your donated phone can change lives and help close Austin's digital divide, thanks to Austin Pathways.\nThanks to Austin Public Library for their partnership. \n\n\n\nAnd a special thanks to all our sponsors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n "

    As part of our Land Stewardship Series Jeffco Invasive Species Management and Jeffco Open Space will be sponsoring BIG YEAR JEFFCO in 2018.

    Because Jefferson County is home to over 200 species of birds, we decided to encourage people to get outside and document the birds they see within the county. Participants need to register to have their sightings be included in the BIG YEAR JEFFCO official count. Participants will also need an eBird account. eBird is the online venue for documenting the birds participants see and will be the official site for recording BIG YEAR JEFFCO sightings.

    Every social media manager wishes they had a huge budget, a big team and endless number of hours in the day to work with, however, for most businesses, this is not the case. Most social media marketing teams consist of one person who only has a few hours each week to manage Facebook - and all other social media accounts for the business.

    At this Social Media Club of Kansas City breakfast, Travis Pflanz will discuss tips, tactics, and tools for small business success on Facebook. This session is part presentation and a lot of group discussion. Come ready to share your favorite Facebook tactics and share your experiences - good and bad.

    You'll learn:



    Basic Facebook strategies for posting on the business page



    Tools that small businesses can use to automate some of their social media tasks



    A general feeling that they're not alone in the feeling of being over-whelmed (through discussion), and a deepening of community with other SMCKC members

- name: "Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series: Super Cells with Nina Tandon (Rescheduled) "
  description: >+
    This event was originally scheduled for Thursday, April 19, and postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. If you had planned to attend and would still like to, please register again on this page.  From clay and stone to plastic and steel, basic building materials have always shaped our physical world and our sense of possibility. Now we are at the cusp of exploring and exploiting a new substance so groundbreaking that it challenges our very notion of what it means to build. This new material is: life.

    In this keynote, Nina Tandon takes us on an eye-popping tour of the tantalizing array of inventions already being created with nature’s elemental building block, the cell. Imagine the possibilities: broken bridges that have the ability to self-heal, one-stop body-shops for human body parts that render organ donation obsolete, living looms spinning high-tech fabrics, PETA-friendly porterhouse steaks—smarter, more adaptive technologies that may form our future arsenal as we confront looming challenges. With great enthusiasm, Tandon contends that we’re entering a new technological revolution, one in which we can create smarter technologies by making cells our partners in design—often on our own steam, in collaborative biohacking labs. And, she confront the thorny questions that come with playing with the power of life.

    Nina Tandon is CEO and co-founder of EpiBone, the world’s first company growing living human bones for skeletal reconstruction as well as the co-author of Super Cells: Building with Biology, which explores the new frontier of biotech.

    A TED Senior Fellow (she’s spoken at three different TED conferences) and Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Cooper Union, Tandon has a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from the Cooper Union, a Master’s in Bioelectrical Engineering from MIT, a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, and an MBA from Columbia University. Her PhD research focused on studying electrical signaling in the context of tissue engineering, and has worked with cardiac, skin, bone, and neural tissue.
