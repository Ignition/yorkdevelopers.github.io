    A key component of the ISCF Transforming Food Production (TFP) funding mechanism is the Science and Technology into Practice programme, made up of feasibility and demonstration competitions. The programme aims to increase engagement and collaboration between R&D, end-users and all stakeholders. 



    Eligible industrial and academic participants can apply for a share of up to £15 million to provide end users with evidence of technical feasibility and economic viability or demonstrate near market solutions. This funding is from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF). 



    ISCF Transforming Food Production – The Next Phase

     

    Overview

    The Industrial Strategy sets out Grand Challenges to put the UK at the forefront of the industries of the future, ensuring that the UK takes advantage of major global changes, improving people’s lives and the country’s productivity.

    Transforming Food Production is recognised as a key driver of Clean Growth under the Industrial Strategy.

    The £90 million Transforming Food Production programme aims to integrate current world-class UK capabilities (digital technologies, artificial intelligence, engineering, biological, environmental and social sciences) into precision approaches both within new novel production systems and traditional agricultural systems to improve productivity and target net-zero emissions. 

     

     

    Science and technology in practice competition briefing and consortium building events



    These events aim to help attendees apply for this new £15m competition, which aims to increase engagement and collaboration between R&D, end-users (farmers/producers etc) and all stakeholders to:





    Demonstrate near-market solutions at commercial scale and across different farming environments. 

    Provide farmers/producers with evidence of technical feasibility and commercial viability of combinations of precision solutions across one or more demonstration platforms.  

    Embed co-innovation approach to accelerate the development of new solutions





    Your solution must have the potential to improve productivity and sustainability. It must lead to a significant reduction of emissions from agriculture, contributing to the target of net zero emissions from agriculture by 2040. 





    Start and finish times: 9:30am-4:30pm (full agenda to follow)



    This event will allow attendees to;



    Be informed about the competition scope and consortia eligibility

    Focus on end-user participation

    Be informed about and encouraged to collaborate with different sectors 

    Hints and tips on submitting a successful proposal

    Have the opportunity for businesses (including farming/producers), academia, RTO to pitch their ideas, skills and partner needs to bid into TFP

    Make valuable connections





    Unable to Attend? We are also running a Transforming Food Production; Science and Technology into Practice, Feasibility and Demonstration Briefing Event at Stoneleigh Park on 14th November, to register please click here.

    What is IoT?

    IoT (Internet of Things) is a system of interconnected devices and things such as computing machines, mechanical, digital machines, objects, animals that are connected over the internet. These devices and things can transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The built-in technology in the objects helps them interact with internal states or the external environment, which in turn affects the decisions taken.
