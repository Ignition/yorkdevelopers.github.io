You also can use the Eventbrite app.\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the afterparty?\nIf you attend the conference, present your bundle or separate afterparty ticket when you check in to receive a paper afterparty ticket. That paper ticket will be collected at the gate when you enter the afterparty.\nIf you purchased an afterparty ticket separately without attending the conference, please bring your Eventbrite ticket as it's your admission to the event and you will need it to enter.

The WOW Club will be open as well. \nThe name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?\nEach attendee needs to have their own ticket in their own name.\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the conference venue?\nThe most convenient way to get to the venue is by car. Parking is available in the gravel lot adjacent to the building and in the Goss Lane Parking Deck, which can be found on the map (just above the Harrison Education Commons): http://www.augusta.edu/maps/images/healthsciencescampus.pdf \nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the afterparty?\nThe most convenient way to get to the afterparty venue is by car.

Can I get the bundle deal retroactively on my ticket?\nNo. If you think you might want to go to the afterparty, buy the bundle for $10 more. Even if you don't go, proceeds from your purchase will help us make the event even better.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe (the BSidesAugusta Board of Directors) are collecting your data only for BSidesAugusta registration/notification/capacity planning purposes.

In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on, and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how “Web 2.0” represented not only the resurgence of the web after the dot com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the internet as a platform. In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

    "I always look forward to the Watershed Symposium. We are all in this together and we need to engage in opportunities for sharing and building connectivity so that we can effectively address the critical and timely needs that exist in our watershed given our growth projections and never ending need to build awareness.

    As part of our Land Stewardship Series Jeffco Invasive Species Management and Jeffco Open Space will be sponsoring BIG YEAR JEFFCO in 2018.

    Because Jefferson County is home to over 200 species of birds, we decided to encourage people to get outside and document the birds they see within the county. Participants need to register to have their sightings be included in the BIG YEAR JEFFCO official count. Participants will also need an eBird account. eBird is the online venue for documenting the birds participants see and will be the official site for recording BIG YEAR JEFFCO sightings.
