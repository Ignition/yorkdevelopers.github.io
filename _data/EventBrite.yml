- name: York Exponential Robothon 2018
  description: >
    What is Robothon? Robothon is York Exponential’s 32-hour York city hackathon inspired by and focused on the advancement and innovation of collaborative robots (robots that are designed to work alongside and augment humans, not replace them).

    Why are we hosting Robothon?  Robothon’s intention is to introduce the average person to the capabilities of our robots. We will have our engineers on site at all times to introduce functionality and monitor safety, and during the event, attendees will hear from inspiring speakers and have the opportunity to participate in workshops as well as fun activities planned throughout.

    Where and when is Robothon? April 7th-8th

    Robothon will take place from the morning of Saturday, April 7th to the evening of Sunday, April 8th. This is to help usher in robot week which takes place the following week!
