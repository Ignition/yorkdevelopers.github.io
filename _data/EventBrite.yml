    Speaker: Dr Annie Hodgson, Department of Chemistry

    Department of Chemistry Open Lecture

    Some of the most amazing scientific discoveries have been made completely by accident. The sign of a great scientist is that they recognise the significance of what they observe; then led by curiosity and imagination experiment to develop an idea or invention. Whether the accident is the result of a clumsy cat or a careless chemist, serendipity has played an important role in the history of science. Dr Annie Hodgson will take you into the world of serendipitous discoveries and will try to recreate some of these accidents on purpose!

    Speaker: Professor Rob Marchant, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    Coffee has become an export of global significance for countries in East Africa, reaching diverse markets across the world, and with large numbers of farmers involved in its production. There are enormous potential benefits from the growing coffee industry but significant environmental, economic and social challenges are emerging. Drawing on the experience of East Africa this talk will consider the nature of these challenges and how they might be overcome for the benefit of producers and consumers.

- name: 'From scarcity to abundance: How water resource management can contribute to cooperation and stability in the Middle East'
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Clive Lipchin, Arava Institute, Israel

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    The Middle East is one of the world’s most water scarce regions, but also has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. That means water demand is fast outstripping supply and climate change impacts will only exacerbate the issue. Despite this dire reality, Israel today has a water surplus, and has successfully decoupled itself from the vagaries of diminishing freshwater supplies.

    In this presentation Dr Lipchin will discuss how Israel went from a water scarce to a water abundant country. He will discuss the implementation of successful technologies, the government policies and economics that encourage the adoption of a water smart country, and a culture that encourages and supports innovation and conservation. He will also discuss how Israel can leverage its water abundance for regional cooperation and stability.

- name: Should we be worried about indoor air pollution?
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Nic Carslaw, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    In developed countries, we have been estimated to spend about 90% of our time indoors, for instance at home, at work, or commuting between the two. It therefore follows that our exposure to air pollution, whether to pollutants generated indoors or outdoors, happens mainly in the indoor environment. This presentation will introduce the audience to the many ways in which we can be exposed to air pollution indoors, including through activities such as cooking or cleaning. The presentation will finish with some methods for reducing our exposure to pollution indoors as well as some to avoid, along with some thoughts on future issues for indoor air quality.

    Want to make a video game? 

    Learn how by joining the York Game Jam as part of Global Game Jam 2019! Bring along your friends and make a game together, or come and meet new friends.


    How does it work?

    You'll be set a theme for the game on the Friday evening (25th January). Then, over the course of 48 hours you and your fellow team mates will rapidly go through each stage of game development in crunchtime fashion. This covers everything from theme development through to music, artwork and programming. When the deadline hits you will have a fully playable game!

    Industry experts will be coming along on both the Saturday and Sunday to play your games and give you hints and advice!


    No code experience? No problem.

    Whether you're an industry veteran or a total beginner, anyone is welcome to try their hand at making a game – no code experience is required (although having computer skills helps, and we're sure you've got those!).


    ***Introductory workshop***


    In preparation for the Game Jam, we will be running workshops to help you learn how to make a game. More details will be announced soon.



    What do I need to bring?

    Bring your laptops, your friends and your curiosity. Don't forget to bring refreshments to keep up your energy levels, bearing in mind, though, that you're not in any way expected to work through the night. Sleep is a beautiful thing.

    We recommend that you download the software you'd like to use in advance of the Game Jam so you're ready to go. If you're not sure of what you’ll need, see the suggestions on the Game Jam website.


    Sounds fun?

    For more information email enterprise@york.ac.uk, visit www.globalgamejam.org or visit the University of York page on the Global Game Jam site.

    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of September 2018, confirmed speakers will explore areas such as gene therapy, scientific policy making and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

     

    FAQ:


    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. 

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Facebook: facebook.com/YorkScienceConference --> Feel free to message us, we respond rapidly!

    LinkedIn: York Science Conference --> This is our more corporate platform, we're happy to receive questions/thoughts through this medium though.
