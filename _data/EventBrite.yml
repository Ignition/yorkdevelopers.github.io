    The World's Largest DevOps Event,June 5 - 7, 2018at the Javits Center in New York, NY!

    The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.

    The @DevOpsSummit at Cloud Expo - to be held June 5-7, 2018, at the Javits Center in New York, NY - will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of enterprise IT professionals put out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.

    Join @DevOpsSummit Chair June 5-7 for three days of intense DevOps discussion and focus.

    The 2018 K-12 STEM Symposium

    It takes a community of teachers, mentors, parents and local leaders to nurture a child’s curiosity of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Linking science and mathematics taught in the classroom to impactful careers is an ongoing national challenge. This year’s Symposium will help children discover new and exciting possibilities in the STEM fields within the National Capital Region. Elementary, middle and high school students will learn about computer coding, space, 3D printing, drones, connected cars and healthcare through a wide range of fun and interactive exhibitors and speakers.

    High school and college internship opportunities can help students better understand exciting and wide-ranging careers available to those with STEM degrees. Summer and school-year STEM enrichment programs are a large part of a child’s interest in becoming proficient in the mathematics and sciences. Simple tools such as educational science and technology apps, family-friendly physics experiments and robotics building can also influence a child’s proficiently in the math and science.

    Special Thank You to our Presenting Sponsor Altamira Technologies 



     

    Quick Facts:



    This is the fifth year running since the initial STEM Symposium in 2014. We have only grown in size and diversity of age ranges, gender and race

    We project over 3,500 parents, kids and teachers to be in attendance

    Over 50 exhibitors from the business, government, academia and nonprofit sectors will be represented

    Exhibits include 3D printers, drones, flights simulators, physics experiences, heart monitors, topography models, puzzles and many robotics teams

    Over 20 local students will present top science fair projects before regional competition



    Mission and Outcome:

    The largest K-12 STEM Symposium in Northern Virginia, the Symposium provides the opportunity for students, parents and teachers in the National Capital Region (NCR) to interact with key business, education, non-profit and government leaders through real-life applications and presentations about how science, technology, engineering and mathematics impacts our community.

    Parents will be directed to a variety of K-12 STEM opportunities that exist in the National Capital Region.  From academic competitions, internships, after-school activities, special events, science and math enrichment courses, science fairs and more – parents remain in the driver seat of their child’s education.

    Industry leaders also have the opportunity to gauge the proficiency of the local STEM pipeline.

    Bottom Line:

    The opportunities for students who are STEM-proficient are endless. Connecting exciting career opportunities to math and science taught in the classroom is critical for encouraging and keeping children interested in pursuing STEM careers. Get informed. Get excited. Get started.

- name: Canonical Computation in Brains and Machines 2018 Symposium
  description: >-
    The fields of neuroscience and AI have undergone significant transformation over the last ten years, thanks in large part to a rapid expansion in technological capacities that are permitting ever more complex experiments and computations to be carried out. Brain-like computing is becoming common in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But can brains and machines think alike? 

    How will neuroscience and artificial intelligence shape each other’s futures?

    This is a crucial question as our understanding of the brain increases, and the AI in our machines increasingly permeates society, business and the economy. To map the road ahead, this symposium will gather global leaders in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Speakers will not only describe their work but also share their thoughts on the best path going forward.

    BIOTECHNOLOGY DAY KEYNOTE SPEAKER AND PANELISTS




    ABOUT THE KEYNOTE

    Title: "The Development, Manufacture, and Regulation of Biopharmaceuticals in the United States"

    Abstract: We are in the midst of an explosion of creativity and innovation in the development of biotechnology based pharmaceuticals. New technologies and manufacturing strategies, therapeutic proteins addressing unmet medical needs, curative biotherapeutics, biosimilars, and products rushed to market with breakthrough status are all on the rise. The combination of technological innovation, a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, and global market requirements can paint a picture of daunting or energizing complexity. This talk will provide an overview of the regulation of biopharmaceuticals in the United States and explore the current regulatory paradigm of patient centered, risk based oversight employing a totality of evidence framework to assure stable supplies of high quality medicines, a totality of evidence based upon data driven studies, first principle understanding, and sound engineering practices in manufacturing.  

    Speaker: Jeffrey C. Baker, Ph.D. (Deputy Director, Office of Biotechnology Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the United States FDA)

    About the Speaker: Dr. Baker received a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and molecular biology at Northwestern University, his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of North Texas, and completed post-doctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

    Imagining the Extraordinary:Scientific Illustration from the Renaissance to the Digital AgeSymposium

    March 15, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.March 16, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

    Imagining the Extraordinary will explore how creative scientific illustration, often aided by advances in technology, has extended the reach of human understanding about the natural world. Knowledge about everything from the unimaginably large to the inconceivably small was initially nurtured by the popularity and availability of the printed image during and after the Renaissance. In a similar spirit of discovery, modern scientists have harnessed digital visualization techniques to nurture contemplation on everything from coral migration to the human genome.

    Exploring the longstanding relationship between science and illustration, Imagining the Extraordinary will bring together historians, curators, artists, and librarians fluent in the visual vocabulary of the Renaissance and early modern period with modern scientists, technologists, and artists working in the same fields with new digital visualization tools. Scientific illustration provides a unique vantage from which to identify and discuss unifying concepts in scientific discovery, such as evidence and proof, artistic collaboration, imagining the unseen or the perplexing, and rendering images useful to multiple (and often skeptical) audiences. It is our hope that this symposium will provide an opportunity to bring together the many voices that have long been involved in condensing and animating the complexity of the natural world.

    FAQs


    New location for 2018, where do I go?

    All activities for the weekend will be located at the Sheraton Baltimore North, on the first and second floor conference spaces.  Enter the hotel by the Conference Center doors, which will be clearly marked.  They are the doors immediately adjacent to the parking garage entry gate.  Registration will be right inside the doors, by the large video screen.  Venue maps will be placed on the event website.


    Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?

    There are no age limits for BSidesCharm 2018.  However, most, if not all material will be geared towards those over 16.  All children must have a badge and they must be accompanied by an adult guardian at all times.  There will be a Saturday night party at the hotel where you must be at least 21 to drink alcohol (ID will be required at the bar).


    What are my parking options at the event?

    If driving, there is a very large parking garage attached to the Sheraton Hotel.  Parking is available for $10.00/day.  Garage height is 6'6".


    Where can I stay Saturday night?

    We will have a block of discounted rooms at the Sheraton.  We will announce the reservation link via our website - www.bsidescharm.com.


    What can/can't I bring to the event?

    Please bring a positive attitude, a willingness to listen to others and a strong desire to learn.

    All forms of smoking (tobacco, vaping, e-cigs, etc.) are prohibited in the venue.  Designated smoking areas are available outside of the venue.

    The venue also requests that no outside food be brought into the conference spaces.


    What type of badge do I buy?

    The majority of attendees should choose a standard BSidesCharm badge.

    For those with Parallax electronic badges, which were sold last year, we will offer a new 2018 shield that can be attached to your electronic badge. Pick one or the other when buying your ticket. Please look for the option on the ticket page to select the electronic badge shield option. However, if you select the electronic badge shield, you are responsible for bringing a Parallax hackable electronic badge to BSidesCharm 2018.


    Will you have the Parallax electronic badges again?

    Electronic badges will not be available for purchase this year. If you choose the shield option when you buy your ticket, you will be provided with the 2018 shield at the registration table and then you must affix it to your Parallax badge. Electronic badge shields will only be available during online registration. We will not have any extra shields at the event. A shield by itself will not be considered a badge.


    Is my registration/ticket transferrable?

    Tickets may be transferred to others.  If possible, we ask that the original ticket holder log in and change the name on the ticket to match the new ticket holder.  It makes the check-in process flow much smoother.  Please note: if you registered for the 2018 electronic badge shield, the person you transfer the ticket to must have or obtain a Parallax electronic badge.


    Can I update my registration information?

    Yes, you may update registration information after it is entered. This includes changing the name on the ticket if the ticket is given to somebody else.


    Do I have to bring my ticket to the event?

    YES, please have a scanable ticket with you as you arrive at the venue.  You can print it out.  You can have the ticket pdf on your phone.  Just make sure that it is somewhere where we can scan it.  Present the ticket at the registration table to pick up your event badge and materials.


    What is the refund policy?

    Refunds will NOT be granted.  If you have a ticket that you no longer need, there will always be people looking for tickets.


    Who needs a badge?

    Everyone who wants to attend any of the BSidesCharm events, including the Saturday night party must obtain a 2018 badge.  Badges must be visible at all times within the event spaces.  Those refusing to wear an event badge will be asked to leave.


    What if I forget or misplace my badge?

    Replacement badges will be available at the registration table for a cash donation of $20 to one of the official BSidesCharm charities.  Details will be available at the registration table.


    Will you have t-shirts available this year?

    YES, we will have a brand new FREE 2018 BSidesCharm t-shirt available upon check in at registration.  In response to requests, we will be adding female sizes this year.  To make sure we order the correct number of t-shirts though, please select the appropriate size when purchasing your ticket.  If you do not want a t-shirt, that is perfectly fine.  Just select "no t-shirt" on the registration page.  We will also have a small number of current and past t-shirts available in the registration area starting Saturday afternoon.  It will be the same as last year, make a CASH donation to one or more of our official 2018 charities and you will receive the t-shirt of your choice.


    Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?

This presentation uses magic tricks to help students learn the three magic words to keep you safe when you encounter a dangerous situation involving electricity.

    Students in 6th through 12th grade will see First Electric's High Voltage Safety Demonstration. This presentation teaches students how electricity is generated and delivered to your home as well as information about the electric grid and the many safety measures our linemen take to protect themselves while working with high voltage lines. Come let us show you what 7,620 volts of electricity looks like!

    This exciting opportunity for home school families has limited space available so sign up today and reserve a space for your students. There are three time slots your family may choose from; 8:30 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The presentations will take approximately 90 minutes and afterwards, students will be able to test their knowledge by visiting multiple learning stations to learn even more about electricity and electrical safety. Students will also have the chance to visit our dispatch center to get a behind the scenes look at the technology and coordination it takes to deliver safe and reliable electricity to thousands of homes, businesses and farms in our state. #FirstElectric#ImprovingQualityofLife

    THE TALK: Athletic Performance and Strength Training for Aging Populations

    Through his company, Power Athlete, John is able to focus on his true passion, foster and developing athleticism. Over the years, John has been fortunate to work with athletes of all ages and has had extensive experience working with aging populations of athletes. He breaks them down into categories based on chronological age and “training” age. The groups he is going to focus on in his talk are the under 50 athletes and over 50 athletes with and without an extensive training age. What can these two groups implement today that can help to keep fostering athleticism and keeping them fit for the years to come? How can they slow the hands of time by using methods found in the weight room and basic strength training to keeping fit and young? And what modalities can be added to any physical training routine to maximize progress and bridge the gap between aging and the desire to keep driving performance? How does nutrition, blood testing, sleep and movement come into play in keeping fit and young?

    John Welbourn is a 9-year veteran of the National Football League and CEO of Power Athlete. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a BA in Rhetoric and did did his masters work in Education at the University of California. While playing football at Berkeley, John was a four-year letterman. John was selected in 1999 NFL Draft and went on to be a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999-2003, appearing in 3 NFC Championship games, then for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2004-2007. In 2008, he played for the New England Patriots until a pre-season injury ended his season. Over the course of his NFL career, John started over 100 games in addition to 10 play-off appearances.

    In 2008 while still an active NFL player, John competed in the CrossFit Games. After retiring in 2009, he was approached by CrossFit to start a sport specific offering of CrossFit called CrossFit Football.

    Since retiring from the NFL in 2009, John has consulted and trained athletes in MLB, NHL, NFL, CrossFit and the Olympics. He has also worked in the same capacity for Naval Special Warfare, teaching performance and training for Navy SEALs. He works as a consultant for PowerDot, Form Lifting Collar, NeuroArmour and other fitness technologies to help to develop cutting edge training products for performance based athletes. John travels the world lecturing on performance and nutrition and as an expert on food for performance.

    In 2010, John launched Power Athlete, a program designed to maximize performance for power and strength athletes looking to develop strength and speed. You can follow John at his personal blog, Talk To Me Johnnie or on Twitter or Instagram @JohnWelbourn.

- name: '10th Annual Biard Lecture: "Planet Nine from Outer Space" (Mike Brown)'
  description: "\"Planet Nine from Outer Space\"Mike Brown (Professor of Planetary Astronomy, Caltech)\nRecent evidence suggests that a massive body is lurking at the outskirts of our solar system, far beyond the orbits of the known giant planets. This object, at a distance approximately 20 times further than Neptune and with a mass approximately 5000 times larger that Pluto, is the real ninth planet of the solar system. I will talk about the observation that led us to the evidence for this Planet Nine and discuss how so massive an object could have been hiding in the outer solar system for so long. Finally I will discuss the international effort to pinpoint this newest member of our planetary family.\nMike Brown is a Professor of Planetary Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology where he teaches classes from introductory physics to the science of the solar system. He is a native of Huntsville, Alabama, where he grew up listening to the tests of the Saturn rockets preparing to go to the moon, and he received his undergraduate degree in physics from Princeton University and his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of California at Berkeley. He and his research group spend their time searching for and studying the most distant objects in the solar system and drinking coffee.\nThe Annual R.
