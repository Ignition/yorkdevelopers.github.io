- name: Women in Tech York - Innovative Tech
  description: >-
    Welcome to Women in Tech York's Innovative Tech event!

    Who are we?

    We are a community of like-minded people studying, working or interested in technology. Our goal is to run events in which we can share our knowledge and interests as well as encourage and empower one another. This event is not exclusive to women; we welcome anyone passionate about tech and increasing diversity in the field.

    We also welcome all students who are interested in learning more about Tech, and the careers it entails.


    This month...

    We will be learning about Innovative tech with two incredibly interesting talks, details of which are below.

    As always, there will be a free buffet (vegetarian and vegan options avaliable) thanks to our sponsors Isotoma, Mitrefinch and Netsells.


    Event Timings:

    18:00: Registration Opens

    18:30: Introduction

    18:40: How to build an innovation culture - Bethan Vincent

    Innovation doesn't happen by accident, it's a product of good design.

    Bethan's talk will explore some of the conditions organisations can create that allow teams to think of, and most importantly deliver on, market changing ideas.

    She will also present the innovation hierarchy - a methodology for thinking about innovation at different scales, from internal to market altering.

    Bethan is Head of Marketing at Netsells. With experience leading and contributing to cross-functional Marketing and Product teams, Bethan is used to bringing ideas to market at speed.

    19:10: Buffet and networking

    19:50: Connected York - Melissa Magson - Graphic & Web Designer and Andrew Stark - Marketing Consultant from We Are Connected

    Melissa and Andrew will take us through the rollercoaster of emotions and challenges in envisioning, developing, funding and promoting an App which they believe will help York (and any other city’s) visitors and residents and retailers. From the initial spark of an idea, scoping it’s functionality and keeping sight of the opportunity, the We Are Connected story will make many nod in recognition and, we hope, encourage others to keep going with their ideas.

    Andrew is a marketing consultant with over 20 years’ experience working with large corporates and small agencies in the financial, beverage, utilities, manufacturing, charity and telecoms markets. Although this often led to work for overseas territories such as UAE, India, USA and Iberia, it came as a relief when the commuting came to an end in 2017. Deciding to go freelance and work on a consultancy capacity, Andrew takes a great pleasure in working with clients and people where they share a passion for the product or service. www.starkenstein.co.uk

    Melissa has worked in tech for over 15 years beginning with software testing for a multinational logistics firm through to project management and assisting with SAP training & implementation for a large construction company, then moving on to York-based tech firm Merisis Technology based at the York Science Park.  Merisis develop web and mobile applications for a range of SMEs to large multi-national corporations. Melissa initially took on the role of business development manager, maintaining relationships with current clients and bringing in new business. Being part of this small firm brought the opportunity to work in many different areas of the business and here Melissa was able to explore and develop her design skill-set. Working on web and mobile application designs for the likes of Moores Furniture Group, comparethemarket.com, Glenmorangie, Touchright Software and NYK Logistics. More recently Melissa founded her own business Melissa Magson Design Studio, working on a part-time consultancy basis with Merisis Technology to continue to develop and design their web and mobile applications. Melissa has grown her client base and supports many local start-up businesses - developing their brand identities, web designs and marketing collateral. She proudly continues to design for many local SMEs such as Ainsty Ales, Sock Club UK, Thora & the Prince, Imagine Projects, Scotts Fish & Chips, The Little Balloon Co and many more.  www.melissamagson.co.uk

- name: Global pollution in urban environments
  description: >-
    During this lunchtime seminar, researchers at the University of York will discuss their research into global pollution in urban environments. Confirmed speakers include Dr. Harry Vallack from the Stockholm Environment Institute and Dr. Adam Vaughan from the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL).

    Dr. Harry Vallack, Senior Research Asoociate for Stockholm Environment Institute in York (SEI-Y)

    Harry Vallack is an ecologist specialising in air pollutant emissions inventories, carbon dynamics of plant/soil systems, ambient dust pollution monitoring and issues relating to persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

    Harry has over 25 years experience working on various aspects of air pollution at scales ranging from local to global. This has included capacity building within non-OECD countries (including developing of suitable manuals/software) for the preparation of air pollutant emissions inventories, producing air pollution emission scenario projections for developing country regions.

    Harry’s current research interests concern short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), global change ecology, soil carbon dynamics and capacity building for emissions inventory preparation in developing countries. In the process of this research, he has developed software tools to enable developing countries to compile air pollutant emission inventories. More recently he has helped develop a tool to assist countries prioritise alternative SLCP mitigation strategies, going from emissions estimates through to likely impacts on human health crop production and climate.

    Dr. Adam Vaughan, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL)

    Adam is a postdoctoral researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) since 2017, specialising in urban emission measurements. WACL is the UK’s first dedicated laboratory building for atmospheric chemistry research. Adam obtained his Master’s in Chemistry from the University of Hull in 2013, and his PhD in Chemistry from the University of York in 2017, working with Prof. James Lee and Prof. Lucy Carpenter. His PhD focused on assessing UK emissions from a low flying aircraft. His work led to the first direct assessment of Greater London emissions from an aircraft through eddy-covariance, highlighting that London’s NOx emissions were being underestimated in the National Inventory. Since completing his PhD, Adam has developed a range of techniques for assessing urban emissions through enhanced eddy-covariance methodologies. He has made air quality measurements on multiple global field campaigns and more recently led research in New Delhi measuring vehicle emissions through remote sensing techniques.

    Health in Urban Environments Event Series

    The event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.

    Through a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.

    By bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.

    The series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York.

- name: Clean Air Day- air pollution and York
  description: "Air pollution, its all over the news and all over our cities, but what do you really want to know about it?  Come along to find out about air quality research at the University of York, how it relates to this beautiful city and where it impacts on our everyday lives. Take the opportunity to quiz experts from the University and York City Council on all things air pollution, and consider the simple things that can be done to help improve the air we breathe.\nHosted by the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York, this event aims to raise awareness of air pollution issues - particularly in York - ahead of Clean Air Day (20th June), the UK’s largest air pollution campaign.\nAbout the speakers\nDr David Carslaw is a Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York. His research is focussed on developing a better understanding of urban air pollution, particularly around emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Much of his work is aimed at better quantifying vehicle emissions under urban driving conditions. Another area of focus is the development of receptor modelling approaches to improve understanding of the influence of different emission sources on ambient concentrations. \nAlastair Lewis is Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York working within the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories. He is also currently Deputy Director of, and Director for atmospheric composition, at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). He has participated in over 30 major atmospheric science field projects, from polar regions to tropical oceans, city centres to remote forests. He is a member of a number of expert advisory groups including for Defra, the World Meteorological Organisation and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nLiz Bates is a University of York alumni employed as a specialist air quality officer at City of York Council and City of Bradford MDC. She helped develop the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) and Low Emission Strategy (LES) for York and has a specialist interest in low emission planning. She helps to co-ordinate Clean Air Day activities in York.\nHealth in Urban Environments Event Series\nThe event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.\nThrough a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.\nBy bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.\nThe series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York."
