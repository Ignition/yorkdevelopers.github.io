    The 2018 K-12 STEM Symposium

    It takes a community of teachers, mentors, parents and local leaders to nurture a child’s curiosity of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Linking science and mathematics taught in the classroom to impactful careers is an ongoing national challenge. This year’s Symposium will help children discover new and exciting possibilities in the STEM fields within the National Capital Region. Elementary, middle and high school students will learn about computer coding, space, 3D printing, drones, connected cars and healthcare through a wide range of fun and interactive exhibitors and speakers.

    High school and college internship opportunities can help students better understand exciting and wide-ranging careers available to those with STEM degrees. Summer and school-year STEM enrichment programs are a large part of a child’s interest in becoming proficient in the mathematics and sciences. Simple tools such as educational science and technology apps, family-friendly physics experiments and robotics building can also influence a child’s proficiently in the math and science.

    Special Thank You to our Presenting Sponsor Altamira Technologies 



     

    Quick Facts:



    This is the fifth year running since the initial STEM Symposium in 2014. We have only grown in size and diversity of age ranges, gender and race

    We project over 3,500 parents, kids and teachers to be in attendance

    Over 50 exhibitors from the business, government, academia and nonprofit sectors will be represented

    Exhibits include 3D printers, drones, flights simulators, physics experiences, heart monitors, topography models, puzzles and many robotics teams

    Over 20 local students will present top science fair projects before regional competition



    Mission and Outcome:

    The largest K-12 STEM Symposium in Northern Virginia, the Symposium provides the opportunity for students, parents and teachers in the National Capital Region (NCR) to interact with key business, education, non-profit and government leaders through real-life applications and presentations about how science, technology, engineering and mathematics impacts our community.

    Parents will be directed to a variety of K-12 STEM opportunities that exist in the National Capital Region.  From academic competitions, internships, after-school activities, special events, science and math enrichment courses, science fairs and more – parents remain in the driver seat of their child’s education.

    Industry leaders also have the opportunity to gauge the proficiency of the local STEM pipeline.

    Bottom Line:

    The opportunities for students who are STEM-proficient are endless. Connecting exciting career opportunities to math and science taught in the classroom is critical for encouraging and keeping children interested in pursuing STEM careers. Get informed. Get excited. Get started.

    The World's Largest DevOps Event,June 5 - 7, 2018at the Javits Center in New York, NY!

    The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.

    The @DevOpsSummit at Cloud Expo - to be held June 5-7, 2018, at the Javits Center in New York, NY - will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of enterprise IT professionals put out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.

    Join @DevOpsSummit Chair June 5-7 for three days of intense DevOps discussion and focus.

  description: >+
    Tickets go on sale March 1st, 2018 at 1:59 PM EST

     

    What is Stir Trek: 2018 Edition?

    Stir Trek: 2018 Edition is our tenth iteration for the Stir Trek conference. As before we're stirring web, mobile, client, and cloud development topics together along with quality, security, soft skills, design, and user experience content to present a fun day of learning. There will be eight tracks of sessions, breakfast, lunch, and a private screening of Avengers: Infinity War, which opens in theaters the day of the event - May 4th, 2018.



    What Topics Are Being Covered?

    The Stir Trek website lists the current Schedule, Sessions and Speakers that we have confirmed.



    What Does It Cost?

    In order to cover the significant costs of a large scale event like this one, there will be a $125 fee for attendance. This will be the best $125 you spend this year, however. Take a look at what you get.



    What Do I Get?

    It is our goal to bring you significantly greater value than your $125, and here’s how we intend to do it:


    Registration materials mailed ahead of event

    48 sessions of critical content

    Well-known regional and national speakers

    Lunch and Breakfast

    Attendee T-shirt

    Private screening of Avengers: Infinity War at the end of the day

    Refreshments during the movie



    How Many Tickets Can I Order at Once?

    Like previous years, you can order up to 20 tickets in one order.  If you need more than 20 tickets for your team, you will need to place multiple orders.  Please make sure that you include the appropriate name, address, and t-shirt size for each person you're buying a ticket for.  There's nothing more disappointing than receiving an awesome box from a conference and getting a shirt two sizes too small.



    How do I know what size t-shirt to order?

    We have creating sizing charts for our shirts to help you get a feel for which size will fit you best.  We offer both m

    en's and women's styles, so make sure you pick the cut that you prefer.




     Can I Buy Another Movie Ticket?

    Like our previous events we will be offering a limited sale of additional movie passes at a later date.  Registered conference attendees will be notified when additional movie passes are available for purchase.  Once these additional passes are sold out we can not offer any more.

- name: Canonical Computation in Brains and Machines 2018 Symposium
  description: >-
    The fields of neuroscience and AI have undergone significant transformation over the last ten years, thanks in large part to a rapid expansion in technological capacities that are permitting ever more complex experiments and computations to be carried out. Brain-like computing is becoming common in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But can brains and machines think alike? 

    How will neuroscience and artificial intelligence shape each other’s futures?

    This is a crucial question as our understanding of the brain increases, and the AI in our machines increasingly permeates society, business and the economy. To map the road ahead, this symposium will gather global leaders in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Speakers will not only describe their work but also share their thoughts on the best path going forward.

    Imagining the Extraordinary:Scientific Illustration from the Renaissance to the Digital AgeSymposium

    March 15, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.March 16, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

    Imagining the Extraordinary will explore how creative scientific illustration, often aided by advances in technology, has extended the reach of human understanding about the natural world. Knowledge about everything from the unimaginably large to the inconceivably small was initially nurtured by the popularity and availability of the printed image during and after the Renaissance. In a similar spirit of discovery, modern scientists have harnessed digital visualization techniques to nurture contemplation on everything from coral migration to the human genome.

    Exploring the longstanding relationship between science and illustration, Imagining the Extraordinary will bring together historians, curators, artists, and librarians fluent in the visual vocabulary of the Renaissance and early modern period with modern scientists, technologists, and artists working in the same fields with new digital visualization tools. Scientific illustration provides a unique vantage from which to identify and discuss unifying concepts in scientific discovery, such as evidence and proof, artistic collaboration, imagining the unseen or the perplexing, and rendering images useful to multiple (and often skeptical) audiences. It is our hope that this symposium will provide an opportunity to bring together the many voices that have long been involved in condensing and animating the complexity of the natural world.

    Rare Book and Special Collections Open HouseMarch 15, 2018 | 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.All ticketed guests of the "Imagining the Extraordinary" Symposium are invited to attend an open house and treasures display in the Library's Rare Book and Special Collections Division.

  description: >-
    On Friday, April 20 home school families are invited to visit First Electric Cooperative in Jacksonville for a Home School Families - Electrical Safety Day. This event will allow students of all ages to learn more about electricity and how to live, work and play safely around it.

    This year we have an exciting Science Show presented by the Museum of Discovery to kick things off.  This presentation will be loaded with cool science experiements that are sure to amaze both students and parents alike.

    For 1st through 5th grade students, we will have a special guest here to present an age-appropriate presentation called "Making Accidents Disappear". This presentation uses magic tricks to help students learn the three magic words to keep you safe when you encounter a dangerous situation involving electricity.

    Students in 6th through 12th grade will see First Electric's High Voltage Safety Demonstration. This presentation teaches students how electricity is generated and delivered to your home as well as information about the electric grid and the many safety measures our linemen take to protect themselves while working with high voltage lines. Come let us show you what 7,620 volts of electricity looks like!

    This exciting opportunity for home school families has limited space available so sign up today and reserve a space for your students. There are three time slots your family may choose from; 8:30 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The presentations will take approximately 90 minutes and afterwards, students will be able to test their knowledge by visiting multiple learning stations to learn even more about electricity and electrical safety. Students will also have the chance to visit our dispatch center to get a behind the scenes look at the technology and coordination it takes to deliver safe and reliable electricity to thousands of homes, businesses and farms in our state. #FirstElectric#ImprovingQualityofLife

- name: '10th Annual Biard Lecture: "Planet Nine from Outer Space" (Mike Brown)'
  description: "\"Planet Nine from Outer Space\"Mike Brown (Professor of Planetary Astronomy, Caltech)\nRecent evidence suggests that a massive body is lurking at the outskirts of our solar system, far beyond the orbits of the known giant planets. This object, at a distance approximately 20 times further than Neptune and with a mass approximately 5000 times larger that Pluto, is the real ninth planet of the solar system. I will talk about the observation that led us to the evidence for this Planet Nine and discuss how so massive an object could have been hiding in the outer solar system for so long. Finally I will discuss the international effort to pinpoint this newest member of our planetary family.\nMike Brown is a Professor of Planetary Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology where he teaches classes from introductory physics to the science of the solar system. He is a native of Huntsville, Alabama, where he grew up listening to the tests of the Saturn rockets preparing to go to the moon, and he received his undergraduate degree in physics from Princeton University and his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of California at Berkeley. He and his research group spend their time searching for and studying the most distant objects in the solar system and drinking coffee.\nThe Annual R. Jack and Forest Lynn Biard Cosmology and Astrophysics Lecture Series\nAn annual series of lectures created and endowed by a generous estate gift by the late Captain Forrest R. Biard, U.S. Navy. Free and open to the public, the annual lectures bring recognized speakers at the forefront of cosmology and astrophysics research to campus for the benefit of the university and central Ohio community.\n\nJoin us in the atrium immediately following the event for mingling and booksigning opportunity with Mike Brown. \nFAQs\n Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nAll ages are welcome, especially kids! The talk will be given at a level easily understood by a general audience.\n What are my parking options for the event?\nParking is available in COSI's new underground parking garage located immediately west of the building. $6 for General Public | $5 for COSI Members.

    THE TALK: Athletic Performance and Strength Training for Aging Populations

    Through his company, Power Athlete, John is able to focus on his true passion, foster and developing athleticism. Over the years, John has been fortunate to work with athletes of all ages and has had extensive experience working with aging populations of athletes. He breaks them down into categories based on chronological age and “training” age. The groups he is going to focus on in his talk are the under 50 athletes and over 50 athletes with and without an extensive training age. What can these two groups implement today that can help to keep fostering athleticism and keeping them fit for the years to come? How can they slow the hands of time by using methods found in the weight room and basic strength training to keeping fit and young? And what modalities can be added to any physical training routine to maximize progress and bridge the gap between aging and the desire to keep driving performance? How does nutrition, blood testing, sleep and movement come into play in keeping fit and young?

    John Welbourn is a 9-year veteran of the National Football League and CEO of Power Athlete. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a BA in Rhetoric and did did his masters work in Education at the University of California. While playing football at Berkeley, John was a four-year letterman. John was selected in 1999 NFL Draft and went on to be a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999-2003, appearing in 3 NFC Championship games, then for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2004-2007. In 2008, he played for the New England Patriots until a pre-season injury ended his season. Over the course of his NFL career, John started over 100 games in addition to 10 play-off appearances.

    In 2008 while still an active NFL player, John competed in the CrossFit Games. After retiring in 2009, he was approached by CrossFit to start a sport specific offering of CrossFit called CrossFit Football.

    Since retiring from the NFL in 2009, John has consulted and trained athletes in MLB, NHL, NFL, CrossFit and the Olympics. He has also worked in the same capacity for Naval Special Warfare, teaching performance and training for Navy SEALs. He works as a consultant for PowerDot, Form Lifting Collar, NeuroArmour and other fitness technologies to help to develop cutting edge training products for performance based athletes. John travels the world lecturing on performance and nutrition and as an expert on food for performance.

- name: 'Trottier Symposium: Planning for Resiliency in the Face of Climate Change'
  description: "\nThe 5th annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy and Design\n\nPLANNING FOR RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nEngineering and design for sustainability are an essential part of a multi-faceted response to climate change particularly in urban centres, which may include increasing our resiliency in the face of extreme weather events, changing our water management practices, or adapting our cities and infrastructure to an unpredictable future. There is a need to identify robust strategies for responding to the challenges brought by climate change through adaptation, reorganization, and evolution. Our response to climate change must include solutions that allow our socio-ecological systems to not only survive, but thrive.\nThe 2018 5th Annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy, and Design will focus on resilience and human responses to the threats brought on by climate change, while considering the following questions:\n\nWhat is resilience and why is it so important to ensure sustainability in the context of urbanization and climate change?\nHow can we be more resilient to disruptions such as extreme weather events, floods, drought, sea level rise, and heat waves? What solutions are being imagined, developed, and implemented?\nHow can infrastructure be protected and self-renewed following extreme weather events or other stresses exacerbated by climate change?\n\n\nSpeakers\nThe symposium is a free, public event, featuring prominent speakers on each day of the 2 day event. \nApril 4th - Day 1 - 6pm to 8pm\nGuy Nordenson, Professor of Structural Engineering and Architecture, Princeton University School of Architecture\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nPippa Brashear, Director of Planning and Resilience, SCAPE\n\nDESIGNING FOR RESILIENCE: ECOLOGY + ENGINEERING + ENGAGEMENT\n\nTranslating the ideas of resilience into realizable actions and implementable designs can be challenging. We are forced to design with uncertain and incomplete information for an environment that is changing around us. However, the need for action and innovation is urgent, and success requires collaborative and interdisciplinary action. This presentation explores the process that has taken one innovative coastal resilience project from conceptual idea to the later stages of design and the lessons learned about integrating and implementing physical, ecological, and social resilience on the way.\n\n\n\nApril 5th - Day 2 - 6pm to 8pm\nKaren Seto, Professor of Geography and Urbanization Science, Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\n\nPhilippe Gourbesville, Professor Hydroinformatics and Water Engineering, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis\nRESILIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CITIES\nDuring the last decade, urban development has reached new submits with generation of mega cities that concentrates several millions of inhabitants. Those new urban environments represent unknown challenges for modern societies that are still using – implicitly or explicitly – the same concepts for urban development since millennia. Sustainability of urban centres is today a major priority that has to be approached in a holistic way. The size of cities requests to rethink and review some of the engineering concepts that are currently used and to shift from the centralized approach to the distributed and connected paradigm. At the same time, gradual sophistication of urban environment has generated a significant increase of global vulnerability regarding extreme weather events that are frequently affecting urban communities. \n\nMore Information: http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables\n\nVers une Stratégie de Résilience Face aux Changements Climatiques \n En matière de développement durable, l’ingénierie et la conception sont des éléments essentiels à une réponse multidimensionnelle au changement climatique, particulièrement dans les centres urbains. Il pourrait s’avérer nécessaire d’augmenter notre résilience dans le contexte des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, de changer nos pratiques de gestion des ressources en eau ou d’adapter nos villes et nos infrastructures pour faire face à un avenir imprévisible. Nous devons donc définir de solides stratégies pour répondre aux défis entraînés par les changements climatiques, grâce à l’adaptation, à la réorganisation et à l’évolution. Notre réponse aux changements climatiques doit comprendre des solutions qui permettront non seulement à nos systèmes socio-écologiques de survivre, mais également de prospérer.\nLe 5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables, édition 2018, porte principalement sur la résilience et les réponses humaines aux menaces qui découlent des changements climatiques, tout en se penchant sur les questions suivantes :\n\nQu’est-ce que la résilience et pourquoi est-il si important d’assurer la durabilité dans le contexte de l’urbanisation et des changements climatiques?\nComment pouvons-nous faire preuve d’une plus grande résilience aux perturbations comme les phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, les inondations, les périodes de sécheresse, l’élévation du niveau de la mer et les vagues de chaleur? Quelles solutions sommes-nous en train de concevoir, d’élaborer et de mettre en œuvre?\nComment pouvons-nous protéger les infrastructures et comment celles-ci peuvent-elles s’autorenouveler sous le coup des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes ou des autres stress aggravés par le changement climatique?\n\n\n\nConférenciers\n\nÉvénement public gratuit, le symposium présente des conférenciers de renom durant les deux jours du symposium. Les présentations seront données en anglais. \n  \n\n4 avril – 1re journée – de 18 h à 20 h\n\nGuy Nordenson, professeur, ingénierie structurale et architecture, école d’architecture de l’Université Princeton\nPippa Brashear, directrice de la planification et de la résilience, SCAPE\n \n\n5 avril – 2e journée - de 18 h à 20 h\n\nKaren Seto, professeure, géographie et études en urbanisme, école de foresterie et d’études environnementales de l’Université Yale \nPhilippe Gourbesville, professeur, hydro-informatique et ingénierie de l’eau, Université Nice-Sophia-Antipolis\n \nPour en savoir plus : http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n"
