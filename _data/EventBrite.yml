     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    What did people say about previous DevOpsDays Chicago events?

    "I walked into the Chicago DevOps conference without a job in tech, at the beginning of my code school learning experience, alone, where I was assured to be the odd person out by being female and having to google devops the day beforehand. I walked into that conference and learned so much from the experience." - Cora Hays-Magan

    "The talks were informative, enjoyable, and in a few cases, downright enlightening. Open Spaces, the concept of which kind of worried me beforehand, proved to be fantastic forums for sharing. I learned a lot, made some great connections, and can't wait for my next one." - Michael Goodness

    "Organizing events is hard. Very impressed with the team that put on @devopsdaysChi. Loved the public retrospective in the open space today" - @czaroxiejka

    "I'm a geek + I love tools but I think I finally grokked the Culture + Empathy part of devops. Thanks to @devopsdaysChi for making that clear" - @darron

- name: 'gShowdown: Blockchain, is it worth the hype and B2B vs B2C'
  description: >-
    It's goin down, Galvanize style. HOT TOPICS, COLD BEER.

    Thanks to our sponsor: 

    Join us for the SECOND in a series of events that will put our communities' experts on two sides of an issue facing the tech community in head to head debate-style showdown. This is the only live debate in town where the audience decides who wins.

    That's right... YOU decide who wins the gShowdown Belt at the end of the debate. 

    Our second ever gShowdown will feature TWO hot topics related to TECH. 

    IS BLOCKCHAIN WORTH THE HYPE?

    Blockchain. The technology that has a solution for every problem, from providing IDs to refugees to enabling people to sell their home without a real estate agent. Companies across industries are trying to capatilize on the technology, with initial coin offerings even being spoofed on HBO's tech startup comedy, Silicon Valley. But is the technology worth the hype, especially if it's less efficient than existing databases? YOU DECIDE!

    Debaters:



    JAY M. WILLIAMS | LINKEDINFOUNDER, CTO & MANAGING PARTNER

    Jay has been a chief technology officer and consultant to many of the Global 2000. As a consultant he has developed a highly refined process for managing a company’’s technology infrastructure, including applications, security and network assets. Jay is a highly sought-after high performance computing architect and problem solver and has advised a number of high profile technology companies on their products. Jay is known for a rare combination of deep technology expertise, expert problem solving ability and business acumen. He is widely respected by peers and has influenced many pivotal technology consortia and industry steering groups. He regularly consults with senior technology and business executives and is frequently consulted by venture and capital investors for analyses of new technology strategies.

    WHAT IS THE BEST KIND OF BUSINESS TO START, B2B or B2C?

    Sailpoint, Spiceworks, BigCommerce, WP Engine. All big B2B companies that have been very successful in Austin. Titos, Deep Eddy, Localeur, Kendra Scott. All B2C companies that have also hit it big in Austin. So which is the best business to start here in Austin and which will bring you the most success. YOU DECIDE!

    Jason Ford, Hyping B2B 

    Chief Innovation Office at SaturnFive


    Jason was a geek in high school, but he was also creative and no one told him those two things could go together. So he studied jazz in college instead of computer science, and ended up with a career in digital marketing. After being encouraged by a friend to pursue entrepreneurship—something he had never really considered—he quit his job in 2009 to start a B2B tech company. His company, FeedMagnet, was ultimately acquired by Bazaarvoice in 2014. Jason has spent the past four years working with a number of startups as a mentor, operating partner, investor, and consultant. 

    Ikechi Nwabuisi, Defender of B2C 

    CEO of Tribl


    Nigerian American entrepreneur and former professional football player, Ikechi Nwabuisi, is the Founder of Tribl, a social messaging app for the culture! Ikechi was born and raised in Houston, TX and attended Northwestern University for his undergraduate and Masters.  After taking his best shot at the NFL and being cut twice he started his professional career with Merrill Lynch as a Wealth Manager. He eventually left that job to pursue tech and entrepreneurship while attending McCombs School of Business. He has worked with many of the accelerators here in town and is focused on making an impact in communities of color through technical innovation.

Jay also hosts the Cyentia Podcast, and is the co-author of Data-Driven Security, a book covering data analysis and visualizations for information security. Jay has served as a Senior Data Scientist at BitSight and the Lead Data Analyst on the Verizon annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).Jay also served as President of the MN ISSA from 2010-2012.\r\nData Security, Data Science\r\nWe all want to make the best decisions in our security programs.  However, the complexities of our connected world combined with an intelligent adversary make accurate measurements, and the subsequent decisions, difficult in the best of times and one of the leading complaints is lack of data.  This talk will explore recent research, explore available data sources and present use cases around gathering the data, parsing and aggregating disparate data sources and finally communicating the results.\r\n\r\nTim Crothers, Vice President of Cyber Security, Target Corporation\r\n\r\n \r\nPresentation: Are Breaches Inevitable?\r\n \r\nOverview: It is becoming increasingly common for defenders to believe that breaches are inevitable.  Certainly given that the number of breaches every year continues to rise gives anecdotal evidence that breaches are indeed inevitable.  This is often expressed as “The Defender’s Dilemma” which states that defenders have to be successful 100% of the time whereas attackers only have to be right once.  But is that true?  If it is possible to prevent breaches then why are so many organizations failing at it and what can we do to not fail?  In this talk we’ll unpack these questions and more and attendees will leave with some new approaches and tools for winning the cyber battle.\r\n \r\nTim is a seasoned security leader with over 20 years’ experience building and running information security programs, large and complex incident response engagements, and threat and vulnerability assessments. He has deep experience in cyber-threat intelligence, reverse engineering, and computer forensics. He is a recognized thought leader and author/co-author of 14 books to date as well as regular training and speaking engagements at information security conferences.\r\n \r\nTim is Vice President of Cyber-Security for Target. There he has built and leads the Computer Security Incident Response Team where they are working on using innovative and new techniques and technologies to achieve world class security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMN ISSA members in attendance at the meeting have the opportunity to win several book giveaways recommended by our speakers.\r\n\r\nNaked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data by Charles Wheelan\r\nData Driven Security, by Jay Jacobs and Bob Rudis\r\n“Huntpedia”\r\n\r\nSee other past recommendations. \r\n\r\nFAQs\r\nAre non-members and guests welcome at meetings and events?\r\nYes, we welcome individuals at large from the security community to join us for any of our events. We simply ask that, after experiencing personally the value of our community at two events, individuals consider joining ISSA for the additional benefits that membership provides.\r\nWhy do we have to register to attend meetings and events?\r\nBesides assisting the board with planning logistics for our events, registering for meetings and events, then checking in when you attend, provides you with self-service documentation you can print out to support your CPE credits if you are audited.\r\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\r\nNo, printed tickets are not necessary, you will still be able to check in.  However, having a printed or electronic copy of your ticket does speed up the check in process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Information/image release.  By registering for this event, I agree that:\r\n\r\nI am allowing my contact information included in the registration to be shared with MN ISSA and I may be contacted by MN ISSA\r\nI grant MN ISSA and/or ISSA International the right to use any candid photos or videos taken during the event in future marketing and communication efforts, to include, but not limited to, websites, brochures, advertisements, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, emails, videos and web conferences.\r\n\r\n"

  description: >2+




    The Data Center Austin Conference (DCAC) is more akin to South by Southwest (SXSW) for the data center industry, than your average run-of-the-mill data center conference. Just as SXSW helps “creative people achieve their goals,” likewise, DCAC helps bring the most relevant thought leaders in the data center industry under one roof, in order to collaborate, innovate, and motivate.

    These individuals will discuss what they are doing to support technological developments that are changing the world. 

    By understanding the current needs, investments, and visions of the most highly advanced tech companies such as Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, others in the industry can better equip themselves for tomorrow’s demands in technology.

    Nexus of Creative Science and The Marketplace: Partnerships That Work

    Alignment of basic scientific research with marketable products that meet a need occurs all too infrequently. Converting fundamental science in the laboratory into products and services that improve lives is challenging, usually requiring multidisciplinary partnerships between the public and private sectors. Please join Christopher Topp, Ph.D., Assistant Member and Principal Investigator, Danforth Center, and Warren Shafer, Ph.D., Vice President Global R&D and Regulatory Affairs, Valent Biosciences LLC, in a discussion of new ways in which Danforth Center science on biology of plant roots is informing commercial development of sustainable products for agriculture. Moderated by Vijay Chauhan, Global STL Lead at BioSTL, the discussion will focus on elements of successful partnerships between for-profit companies and not-for-profit research institutions, and how advanced imaging technologies are bridging the gaps between fundamental science and commercial applications.

Where and why humans will be needed as operators and supervisors in these systems will be illustrated, as well as how you can know if your job will one day be threatened by AI and robots.
