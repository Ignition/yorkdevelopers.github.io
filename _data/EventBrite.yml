    --- Joint University of York GCRF IAA Meeting and Departmental Seminar ---


     Stopping the Punjab choking Delhi

    In December 2015, Delhi was named as the ‘most polluted city in world’ surpassing Beijing. The uncontrolled burning of agricultural residues post-harvest in the Punjab (North India) is often cited as a significant factor as the particulate matter (smog) is transported south due to prevailing winds. Pollution in Delhi is so extreme it may have damaged the lung function of half the city’s 4.4 million children so severely that they will never fully recover. The purpose of this meeting is to explore the potential development of rural biorefineries in North India using advances in biotechnology, green chemistry and environmental sensing that offers a viable alternatives to burning of agricultural residues.

Lots of hands-on exposure is the key to learning this technology, so students should have experience using the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), but not necessarily PowerShell.
