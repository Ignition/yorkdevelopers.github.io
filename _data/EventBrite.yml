- name: 'Growing and Regenerating Human Tissue: A New Frontier in Medicine'
  description: >-
    Extraordinary progress is being made in fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The promise of these fields is that we will be able to create a new type of medicine that is a manufactured tissue or organ. This concept is already being used in patients although the full potential won't be realised for many decades. This talk will explore the very diverse range of skills required to create a human tissue that could cure a disease. We will touch on aspects of chemistry, materials science, manufacturing, cell biology and bioengineering to understand the potential of the field and current gaps in our knowledge.

    Kevin Shakesheff is a Professor at the University of Nottingham and is Pro-Vice Chancellor for Science. He directs one of the UK's main centres for regenerative medicine. He has founded 2 spin-out companies to develop products for patient treatment using regenerative drugs and cells.

    Even if this lecture is sold out, seats may become available shortly before the lecture begins. If you already have a ticket, please note that due to the level of interest these events attract, if you are not in your seat by 6.55pm, your ticket may be made available to those who are waiting.Please either print off your ticket or display it to us on your smartphone or tablet on the evening.

    Speaker: Professor Gareth Gaskell, Department of Psychology

    Merchant Adventurers’ Science Discovery Lecture

    While sleep remains in many ways deeply mysterious, researchers are now beginning to recognise the importance of sleep for memory and learning. In this talk Gareth will describe research carried out in his lab that has identified a crucial role for sleep in language acquisition, including ways in which both adults' and children's sleep can improve language learning. He will also talk about the mechanisms with which the brain uses sleep to aid learning, and discuss ways in which boosting your sleep might accelerate the learning process.

    Science for Patient Benefit: Five per cent of the workforce making 80 per cent of patient diagnoses

    Physsoc is delighted to welcome Jenny Marsden, a registered Clinical Scientist working in the NHS, who will discuss the hidden role of healthcare scientists in the NHS; what they do, how they got there, and how they make a difference to the patient journey.

    Jenny Marsden is Principal Clinical Scientist at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. After graduating from Nottingham University with a BSc in Physics with Medical Physics and from Sheffield University with a MSc in Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, she began her workplace training at the Queen’s Medical Centre (QMC), Nottingham in 1999.

    Jenny has been based at the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust for the last 17 years and during that time she has assisted in setting up new radiotherapy services and commissioning other facilities, such as a new brachytherapy service. She manages trainee scientists undertaking the national scientific training programme in medical physics within her department, and is involved with the national scheme, shortlisting, interviewing and examining national trainees.

    A member of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, Jenny also has a special interest in women in STEM and has spoken to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee on the subject.

    Mmmmmmmmmm…. You probably thought that nothing was further away from quantum mechanics than a pub or a garden…. But here they come! Quantum states are going to expand their quirkiness among flowers and pints of lager. Come to listen to what would happen if familiar flowers would become quantum flowers and to marvel about the weirdness of entangled beers...And maybe learn a quantum trick or two!

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

    MTA Networking Fundamentals

    Networking is crucial to computing and over time knowledge gaps occur which reduces effectiveness and performance of a team. In this course, we will focus on the fundamentals of networking concepts and current technologies.

    In today's increasingly connected and technology-driven businesses you need to know how communication and information transfers are enabled by networking technologies such as the internet, intranet, and extranet, local area networks, wide area networks, wireless networking, network topologies, and access methods. You will also build foundational knowledge in various networking concepts, including the OSI model, IP addressing, internet protocols, and more.

    This course is part of the core introductory Microsoft IT Infrastructure certification for anyone considering a career in technology.

    PowerShell Introduction for IT Professionals

    Learn from ground up, from the basics from “what is a cmdlet?” through to discovering all about objects, modules and remoting to get the most out of these technologies. Lots of hands-on exposure is the key to learning this technology, so students should have experience using the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), but not necessarily PowerShell.
