- name: 'Dr Nessa Carey: Epigenetics – Why DNA is Not Your Destiny'
  description: >-
    The world is full of situations where two genetically identical things differ from each other. Think of a maggot and a fly; the identical twins whom you can tell apart; the trillions of cells in your body. These and many more examples tell us that biological life can’t be explained just by thinking about our DNA. Something else must be influencing us, and that something is epigenetics. From new treatments for cancer, to transmission of trauma, epigenetics is teaching us to view the world of biology differently.

- name: 'Professor Martin Hendry: Ripples of Gravity, Flashes of Light'
  description: >-
    The first ever direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations, from the collision of two massive black holes more than a billion light years away, has been widely hailed as the biggest scientific breakthrough of the decade, and led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics to three senior LIGO scientists and pioneers: Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.  August 2017 then saw another spectacular discovery – as for the first time gravitational waves and light were detected from the same cosmic source: a pair of colliding neutron stars 130 million light years distant. Join LIGO scientist Professor Martin Hendry as he explores the amazing technology behind the detection of gravitational waves, and what their discovery might soon tell us about some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics and astronomy.

    Martin Hendry is Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Glasgow, where he is currently Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. He is a senior member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, for which he chairs the LSC Education and Public Outreach Group.

    Research in Focus

    Microscopy is going through a revolution.  Modern computing power, cameras and laser technology have unlocked the ability to image microbial life at high speeds and in three dimensions, advancing our capacity to capture biologically-important events.  Using these tools, our groups have explored the microscopic world; discovering how disease-causing pathogens swim and ‘talk’ to each other, how microbes move in extreme environments, and how carnivorous plants lay insidious traps in the soil. We will talk about how we have used holographic microscopy to study Leishmania, the world's second deadliest parasite, and reveal details of it move through its lifecycle to attack new hosts.  We will explain how some of this work was achieved, what’s going on in our labs at the moment, and what we think the future holds for this cutting-edge technology.

    This event is followed by a drinks reception, exhibition and 3Sixty installation - all attendees welcome.

  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

- name: 'OR Society Online Resource Training: Maths is Fundamental'
  description: >-
    Want to encourage school pupils to engage with maths but not sure how? 

    Maths skills are vital in the field of operational research (OR), where techniques such as problem structuring methods and mathematical modelling are used to analyse complex business situations.

    The OR Society has developed a series of workshops for school groups aged 11-16 years to support maths learning in the classroom. The workshops engage pupils in fun activities that are directly connected to the National Curriculum, building analytical skills and showcasing careers in which these skills are essential. 

    If you are a STEM Ambassador or a member of the OR Society, please join us for a free training session provided by the OR Society and learn how to deliver two popular maths workshops:

    Playing with LEGO

    This session uses LEGO to engage students by building tables and chairs and get them thinking about the different ways and number of combinations available, given a limited number of bricks. This then leads them to develop the most efficient way to build table and chairs if squares and rectangles cost different amounts, and chairs and tables sell for different amounts. The material uses algebra, formulating equations, solving and graphing inequalities, addition and subtraction.

    Playing Snakes and Ladders - Climbing the Career Ladder  

    The aim of this pack is to introduce students to one of the topics of O.R. in a fun and engaging way. It uses a specially designed board game to engage students by moving around the board and exploring the different careers and opportunities available to maths students. Perhaps you become a mathematical comedian and move forwards 4 spaces, or perhaps you buy the wrong plane for BA and move back 2 spaces! This then leads onto how a board game is designed, flow charts and the algorithms behind it. 

    Please register in advance if you wish to attend this training session. Refreshments will be provided to keep you going!

- name: The Interactive Media Showcase
  description: >-
    The Interactive Media Showcase, as part of the annual LUMA festival at the University of York, is organised by students on the BSc in Interactive Media degree programme. It is a showcase designed to show off the sheer variety of skills and talent that the course has to offer. The event has been entirely student-led, with a group of dedicated students working over the past months to organise, promote and develop the event. The showcase will be a great opportunity not only to see what the students on the course are capable of but to meet the talent and engage in an exciting community of students.

    There will be something for everyone at the event, from Critical and User Experience Design pieces to Virtual Reality experiences and humanities dissertation pieces. All of which have been selected to show the very best of what the students are capable. All of the work being showcased will be pieces that have been submitted for previous assignments, showing the calibre and expected quality of work that the students are expected to deliver.  The evening will take place on the University’s Campus East within the Department of Theatre, Film and Television and welcomes those who are excited to see the future of media and mass communication.
