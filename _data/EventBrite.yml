     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?



    Guelph Transit buses arrive at the University of Guelph Bus Loop every hour and half hour.



    If you are planning on driving to this event, please see the UoG Parking facilities information here. Parking is FREE on weekends in all lots on campus.

    Let's Talk Science requests your permission to take photos for the use of promotion and fundraising for future events. We do not publish names of anyone in the photographs, but we may post them on our social media platforms. In addition, this is a public event so media such as local newspaper photographers and video crew may be on site, so we cannot guarantee that you or your child will not be photographed.

    If I make a donation now, can I get tickets early? 



    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?



    Costumes are not required. However, we offer free face painting and wand-making at the event, as well as a "photo booth" where your child can have their turn to dress up like a wizard. 



    Do we sign up for individual classes?



    This event runs mostly as a large "Station Rotation". Some events are scheduled, such as our "Magical Lecture Series", so please refer to your Marauder's Map on the day-of for details. We will send the map in advance via email to EventBrite attendees. Please note that last-minute sign-ups may miss the email, but you will receive a printed map at the front door.

The Unlocking the Mysteries of Genesis Conference seeks to resolve this conflict by answering key questions about the origin of human life, the age of the universe, and how scientific evidence lines up with the Bible.\nThis conference is intended for persons age 12 and up.  Younger children are welcome, but childcare will not be provided.\nSchedule\nThursday, September 13\n  6:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk  6:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   7:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk\nFriday, September 14   1:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   2:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   2:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk \n  5:00 p.m.  Registration and check-in   6:00 p.m.  Mr. Frank Sherwin  \"Scientific Evidences for Creation\"   7:10 p.m.  Break   7:30 p.m.  Dr. Tim Clarey \"Do Dinosaurs Support Evolution?\"   8:30 p.m.  Conclusion and book signing\nSaturday, September 15\n  8:30 a.m.  Dr. Jim Johnson \"Evidence Review: 5 Proofs Creation was Recent\"   9:40 a.m.  Break 10:00 a.m.  Breakout sessions 10:50 a.m.  Break 11:10 a.m.  Breakout sessions 12:00 p.m.  Lunch break* 12:20 p.m.  Lunchtime breakout sessions   1:10 p.m.  Break   1:30 p.m.  Dr. Randy Guliuzza \"Five Minutes with a Darwinist\"   2:30 p.m.  Break   2:40 p.m.  Q&A with all speakers\n*Lunch will be provided and may be eaten during the lunchtime breakout sessions\n"

Our homes, schools, libraries, and governments are increasingly connected with smart devices, and our workplaces could not function without this connectivity among workers, providing sources of data and information, analytics and modeling capabilities, and storage systems.\nWith all this connectivity comes risk and threat as well as benefits: data and information have value, and things of value are stolen. Our devices and our networks must be secured against intrusion, hacking, and theft. Cybersecurity is paramount to maintaining our data security, personal security, financial security, and even national security. \nJoin us as noted threat researcher Earl Carter of Cisco Systems provides an accelerated introduction into the principles of cybersecurity, discusses the nature of common and notable hacking efforts and security breaches, and shares how you and your companies can protect yourselves in an increasingly connected world.\nWe welcome your participation!

All devices will have a factory reset and be set up as new by the team at Austin Pathways’ nationally-recognized “Unlocking the Connection” initiative, which will connect every public housing resident with a digital device, digital literacy training, and a free or very low-cost internet connection.

    6PM: "Understanding Your Aging Brain"

    Age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and ALS are affecting more and more people, as treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes improve. Many of us know someone with an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and it is difficult to understand how a disease can influence someone's personality and ability to perform everyday tasks. Thousands of researchers dedicate their time to improve our understanding of the biological changes which cause clinical symptoms and lead to progressive changes in behavior and function. In this seminar, I will explain the changes in brain structure that accompany degeneration and discuss the strategies that scientists are exploring to prevent disease and improve brain function.

In this role, she maintains an independently-funded research program, while overseeing the Neuroscience Department with the mission of discovering novel, mechanism-based approaches to treat individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. The research in the Cowell Lab aims to determine how intrinsic transcriptional programs underlying neuronal heterogeneity give rise to selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Her research group is comprised of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees who are affiliated with Southern Research’s partner institution, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The lab is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.

In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

    Some of our favorite comments from last year...

    "I always look forward to the Watershed Symposium. We are all in this together and we need to engage in opportunities for sharing and building connectivity so that we can effectively address the critical and timely needs that exist in our watershed given our growth projections and never ending need to build awareness. I love the networking potential and am very proud of the work that Salt Lake County is doing in this area." Lynn DeFreitas, FRIENDS of Great Salt Lake

    "The Symposium is tremendously important to the future of all of Utah." -Zach Frankel, Utah Rivers Council

    "The range of topics was very good and the overall quality of presentations was much better than most technical meetings I have attended recently. Thank you for a great symposium!"

    "This is one of the best opportunities to network and build partnering relationships toward supporting a healthier watershed. The free admission and food makes it possible for all to attend and its timely content makes it appealing to an interesting cross-section of professions and disciplines. Great job!"

    "Great location/facility, topics, presentation structure, opportunity to engage with fellow professionals and community. Seriously one of the best, well-run conferences I've ever attended. "
