    HALF-DAY CONFERENCE

    TEXTURE IN FORMULATIONS

    The SCS Scrub up on Science programme aims to make science fun for schoolchildren, so why can’t adults get in on the act too? This half-day seminar looks at the sensory world of beauty but will focus on the science of delivering products with the right texture and feel, all demonstrated in a ‘hands on’ practical way. Prepare to poke, wobble and spread!

    12.00-12.30pm Coffee & buffet lunch

    12.30-1.00pm SENSORY AND INDULGENCE IN THE WORLD OF BEAUTY Ronan Stafford Global Data This presentation will explore consumer behaviour and innovation in relation to key trends including:


    Experimentation – what drives experimentation and how is this translated into beauty innovation?

    Fresh, Natural and Pure – the importance of natural and how this is encouraging crossovers within food and drink.

    Premiumization and Indulgence – adding value and providing luxury experiences for today’s consumers.


    1.00-1.30pm RHEOLOGY, TEXTURE AND SENSORY: A MESSY PLAY SESSION Neil Cunningham Centre for Industrial Rheology You will never look at squirt of shower gel or a dollop of day cream in the same way again! For all its fearsome equations and complex measuring methods, rheology is in fact merely a methodical way of quantifying what you see and feel when you handle a product. Neil’s Messy Play session replaces the maths with a fun hands-on practical experience where participants will get to poke, wobble and spread a range of everyday products and learn how to recognise those behaviours that we take for granted but never explicitly acknowledge. He will then introduce the key rheological concepts and properties that describe those behaviours and will go on to relate those properties specifically to cosmetic and

    1.30-1.45pm coffee break

    1.45-3.15pm Interactive presentations on formulation and ingredients/textures led by:

    TABLE 1: Adeline Coulson Croda How the old can become the new A showcase of some of Croda’s innovative textures using ingredients in different combinations to create a variety of systems for various applications. Information on the formulations and the key ingredients used will be provided.

    TABLE 2: Helen Hill Azelis From Champagne to Ice Cubes – How to create a world of texture from one formulation During this session, Azelis will present a range of seven different textures created using the same base formulation.

    TABLE 3: Andrea Tomlinson BASF Using emulsion technology to offer new textures During the session a range of novel textures will be presented where traditional emulsion technology has been modified to bring new textures and application effects.

    Each of these three interactive sessions will last 30 minutes and will repeat three times with delegates moving around to each of the three tables.

    With high-speed railways planned across the world, budget limitations pressing for ever more efficient structures and the Paris Agreement demanding more sustainable solutions, there are many challenges to overcome in the rail sector.

    The UK chapter of the IGS want to educate the Industry about the use of geosynthetics in Rail. The symposium will showcase the established use of geosynthetics in rail applications from around the world for over 30 years. It will also discuss how they could be utilised in high speed networks to create steeper embankments, construct abutments, facilitate drainage and many other uses.
