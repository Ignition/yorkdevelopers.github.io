- name: Workshop on Data-Driven Video Storytelling @ The University of York
  description: >-
    Perspective Media: Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement is an EPSRC funded research project exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society. In collaboration with our partners BBC R&D, The Open Data Institute, The Digital Catapult, City of York Council, BAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen and others, we aim to exploit the power of video storytelling for engagement and literacy with data, and the potential of data analytics to reveal new opportunities for storytelling.

    To kick-off the project, we are hosting a 1-day research workshop at the University of York. This workshop will bring together academics, stakeholders from the creative industries and experts in data engagement to explore the opportunities and challenges posed by data-driven video stories. We will begin by sharing and discussing our research vision and plans. The remainder of the day will then be dedicated to the hands-on, experimental development of ideas and concepts for Perspective Media content, and the interrogation of those ideas in terms of the aesthetic, practical and ethical challenges they reveal. The workshop is the first in a series of activities that will be held over the next 18 months, including hackathons and the collaborative production of experimental content. We hope that you can join us to explore the potential of this exciting new content form.

    We hope that you will be able to join us in York!

    HALF-DAY CONFERENCE

    TEXTURE IN FORMULATIONS

    The SCS Scrub up on Science programme aims to make science fun for schoolchildren, so why can’t adults get in on the act too? This half-day seminar looks at the sensory world of beauty but will focus on the science of delivering products with the right texture and feel, all demonstrated in a ‘hands on’ practical way. Prepare to poke, wobble and spread!

    12.00-12.30pm Coffee & buffet lunch

    12.30-1.00pm SENSORY AND INDULGENCE IN THE WORLD OF BEAUTY Ronan Stafford Global Data This presentation will explore consumer behaviour and innovation in relation to key trends including:


    Experimentation – what drives experimentation and how is this translated into beauty innovation?

    Fresh, Natural and Pure – the importance of natural and how this is encouraging crossovers within food and drink.

    Premiumization and Indulgence – adding value and providing luxury experiences for today’s consumers.


    1.00-1.30pm RHEOLOGY, TEXTURE AND SENSORY: A MESSY PLAY SESSION Neil Cunningham Centre for Industrial Rheology You will never look at squirt of shower gel or a dollop of day cream in the same way again! For all its fearsome equations and complex measuring methods, rheology is in fact merely a methodical way of quantifying what you see and feel when you handle a product. Neil’s Messy Play session replaces the maths with a fun hands-on practical experience where participants will get to poke, wobble and spread a range of everyday products and learn how to recognise those behaviours that we take for granted but never explicitly acknowledge. He will then introduce the key rheological concepts and properties that describe those behaviours and will go on to relate those properties specifically to cosmetic and

    1.30-1.45pm coffee break

    1.45-3.15pm Interactive presentations on formulation and ingredients/textures led by:

    TABLE 1: Adeline Coulson Croda How the old can become the new A showcase of some of Croda’s innovative textures using ingredients in different combinations to create a variety of systems for various applications. Information on the formulations and the key ingredients used will be provided.

    TABLE 2: Helen Hill Azelis From Champagne to Ice Cubes – How to create a world of texture from one formulation During this session, Azelis will present a range of seven different textures created using the same base formulation.

    TABLE 3: Andrea Tomlinson BASF Using emulsion technology to offer new textures During the session a range of novel textures will be presented where traditional emulsion technology has been modified to bring new textures and application effects.

    Each of these three interactive sessions will last 30 minutes and will repeat three times with delegates moving around to each of the three tables.

This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \nSign up to join us!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Four: Planting and Writing workshop at the T2/PollinationAllotment \nThis workshop will take place down at the @YSJTerra2 and @ysjpollinationproject1 allotment on Haxby Road, a short bus ride away. We will think about the theme of beginning in ‘the middle’, based on the concept advanced by Deleuze, and we will read extracts from post-apocalyptic science fiction and solar punk. We will plant in rows of wildflower seeds, and then we will individually take a lawn chair off to a corner of the allotment space in order to write or sketch a response to the two experiences. Later, back at YSJ in a warmer environment, we will spend an hour discussing our ideas and developing a plan for an article, poem, short story, visual art, or piece of work for a summer submission to Terra Two. This workshop will be delivered jointly by Liesl King and Abi Curtis.\n"

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites'
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"
