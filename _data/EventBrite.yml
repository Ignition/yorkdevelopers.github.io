    Unlimited Training* 

    Now you can enjoy unlimited training from Omni212. 

    Look for Asterisk* on Omni212 Eventbrite courses.

    Any course published by Omni212 on eventbrite with *Asterisk* on the course title can be taken individually as well as a part of the Unlimited training program.

    These are the terms and conditions:


    Unlimited training periods consist of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively. See appropriate ticket type for price.

    You will have access to the training material, class recordings, across all of the published courses whether you attend or do not attend the Live Instructor Led Online sessions for the unlimited period purchased by you.

    All of the course material, class recordings are yours to keep. You can download.

    Your unlimited training period will start from the first session of the first course that you take.

    Students may enroll in a course and complete the course even if it starts on the last day of the Unlimited period.

    While Omni212 strives to maximize the benefit for the students who purchase any of the unlimited training periods, this program applies only to the published courses for the purchased time period.
