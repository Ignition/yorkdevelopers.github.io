- name: Building a better computer
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Jim Austin, Department of Computer Science

    Computer Science Lectures

    Building computers is a complex task, relatively inefficient, resulting in power hungry systems that untrained individuals cannot alter without some risk to the computer and to themselves. There must be a better way to do this that would make lives easier for everyone.

    Jim Austin has been working on a new concept in computing for over 17 years. Inspired by his immense collection of computers (www.computermuseum.org.uk) he felt it was time to take a fresh look at how we physically build a computer system – this has involved him in a wide range of subjects including, Computer Architectures, Computer networking, 3D topology, chemistry, 3D printing, Manufacturing, Design, physics – a fascinating and challenging journey.

    The idea stems from the basic concept of removing everything from the computer apart from the chips that drive it. The solution started out with a small plastic ball containing the chip which communicates and is powered without wires – throw a pile of balls into bucket and you have your computer – A Ball Computer (ABC).

    The practical conclusion of the ABC idea resulted in the COOL Computer, which will be demonstrated and the story of the journey in reaching the practical solution presented.

    In anticipation of a further round of funding under the ISCF Leading Edge Healthcare Challenge, the KTN is working with Innovate UK on an engagement event to update companies, academics and organisations looking to put proposals into the forthcoming Medicines Manufacturing Challenge Fund Round 2 call of £10million.



    In Round 1, which closed in November 2017, Innovate UK held a £15m competition to invest in innovation projects in medicines manufacturing to be funded through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. Both feasibility and industrial research projects were in scope with a focus on identified technical or commercial challenges. 



    Join Innovate UK and the KTN at this event in York where you will have the opportunity to hear the latest on this as well as pitch for partners and network with others in the sector. Further information will be available on the future scope and details of the call at this event and a follow on webinar for the official competition launch.

- name: Workshop on Data-Driven Video Storytelling @ The University of York
  description: >-
    Perspective Media: Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement is an EPSRC funded research project exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society. In collaboration with our partners BBC R&D, The Open Data Institute, The Digital Catapult, City of York Council, BAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen and others, we aim to exploit the power of video storytelling for engagement and literacy with data, and the potential of data analytics to reveal new opportunities for storytelling.

    To kick-off the project, we are hosting a 1-day research workshop at the University of York. This workshop will bring together academics, stakeholders from the creative industries and experts in data engagement to explore the opportunities and challenges posed by data-driven video stories. We will begin by sharing and discussing our research vision and plans. The remainder of the day will then be dedicated to the hands-on, experimental development of ideas and concepts for Perspective Media content, and the interrogation of those ideas in terms of the aesthetic, practical and ethical challenges they reveal. The workshop is the first in a series of activities that will be held over the next 18 months, including hackathons and the collaborative production of experimental content. We hope that you can join us to explore the potential of this exciting new content form.

    We hope that you will be able to join us in York!

    With high-speed railways planned across the world, budget limitations pressing for ever more efficient structures and the Paris Agreement demanding more sustainable solutions, there are many challenges to overcome in the rail sector.

    The UK chapter of the IGS want to educate the Industry about the use of geosynthetics in Rail. The symposium will showcase the established use of geosynthetics in rail applications from around the world for over 30 years. It will also discuss how they could be utilised in high speed networks to create steeper embankments, construct abutments, facilitate drainage and many other uses.

  description: >-
    The Composites Leadership Forum 2016 UK strategy identified opportunity to grow the current composite product market from £2.3bn to £12bn by 2030. Action is required to produce a Composite industry that is sustainable into the future. Increasing the market penetration of composites will reduce environmental impact through light-weighting and durability, but there is a need to develop cost-effective bio-based materials to further reduce the environmental impact and de-couple prices from oil. This workshop will identify the technology needs and gap perspective and inform where the UK has specific leading position forming a series of recommendations.

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Two: Writing for an Off-World Colony '
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \nSign up to join us!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Two: Writing for an Off-World Colony\nYou are leaving Earth to set up the first off-world colony.  What things would you take with you?  This creative writing workshop asks you to debate this question by looking at stories by some of the great science fiction writers.\nFollowing the popularity of the Festival of Ideas creative writing workshop with the same title, the editors of Terra Two will offer the workshop again, this time with a specific invitation to staff and students as well as members of the public. Staff and students who are interested in working together to facilitate Terra Two workshops in local schools and community venues may find this of particular interest. All are invited to begin creative work which can be submitted to Terra Two: An Ark for Off-World Survival for the next submission deadline, which is the 1st of April. \n\n"
