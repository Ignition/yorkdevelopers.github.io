- name: 'The Central PA RUG Meeting: Streamline Project Management with Bluebeam'
  description: "Collaboration is the new buzz word as construction projects become increasing complex in dealing with numerous parties through conception, design, and building. This month’s meeting will provide an overview of the software tool Bluebeam and how it facilitates working with all the different entities within a construction project.\nFrom the design perspective, you will learn how you can host virtual meetings that enable remote project partners from across time zones to collaborate online – in real time. Replicate a conference room setting, but instead of face-to-face, do it in a digital environment.\nYou will also learn how you can export your 3D design from Revit to create a 3D PDF. See how you can mark-up the PDF to easily communicate with others in the project chain who don’t have access to Revit.\nMoving from design to construction, learn how the presenter’s company leverages Bluebeam for real-time, in-the-field communication. Construction teams have immediate access to the most up-to-date plans. RFIs are answered more quickly reducing costly down time.\nRegister by December 11th to attend in person or tune-in virtually.\n       Doug Galloway Erdman Anthony Senior Mechanical Designer   \n"

    The Certified Ethical Hacker V9 Class

    Introduction

    The Certified Ethical Hacker program is the pinnacle of the most desired information security training program any information security professional will ever want to be in. To master the hacking technologies, you will need to become one, but an ethical one! The accredited course provides the advanced hacking tools and techniques used by hackers and information security professionals alike to break into an organization. As we put it, “To beat a hacker, you need to think like a hacker”. This course will immerse you into the Hacker Mindset so that you will be able to defend against future attacks. The security mindset in any organization must not be limited to the silos of a certain vendor, technologies or pieces of equipment.

    This ethical hacking course puts you in the driver’s seat of a hands-on environment with a systematic process. Here, you will be exposed to an entirely different way of achieving optimal information security posture in their organization; by hacking it! You will scan, test, hack and secure your own systems. You will be taught the five phases of ethical hacking and taught how you can approach your target and succeed at breaking in every time! The five phases include Reconnaissance, Gaining Access, Enumeration, Maintaining Access, and covering your tracks!
