     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.

    What did people say about previous DevOpsDays Chicago events?

    "I walked into the Chicago DevOps conference without a job in tech, at the beginning of my code school learning experience, alone, where I was assured to be the odd person out by being female and having to google devops the day beforehand. I walked into that conference and learned so much from the experience." - Cora Hays-Magan

    "The talks were informative, enjoyable, and in a few cases, downright enlightening. Open Spaces, the concept of which kind of worried me beforehand, proved to be fantastic forums for sharing. I learned a lot, made some great connections, and can't wait for my next one." - Michael Goodness

    "Organizing events is hard. Very impressed with the team that put on @devopsdaysChi. Loved the public retrospective in the open space today" - @czaroxiejka

    "I'm a geek + I love tools but I think I finally grokked the Culture + Empathy part of devops. Thanks to @devopsdaysChi for making that clear" - @darron

- name: 'gShowdown: Blockchain, is it worth the hype and B2B vs B2C'
  description: >-
    It's goin down, Galvanize style. HOT TOPICS, COLD BEER.

    Thanks to our sponsor: 

    Join us for the SECOND in a series of events that will put our communities' experts on two sides of an issue facing the tech community in head to head debate-style showdown. This is the only live debate in town where the audience decides who wins.

    That's right... YOU decide who wins the gShowdown Belt at the end of the debate. 

    Our second ever gShowdown will feature TWO hot topics related to TECH. 

    IS BLOCKCHAIN WORTH THE HYPE?

    Blockchain. The technology that has a solution for every problem, from providing IDs to refugees to enabling people to sell their home without a real estate agent. Companies across industries are trying to capatilize on the technology, with initial coin offerings even being spoofed on HBO's tech startup comedy, Silicon Valley. But is the technology worth the hype, especially if it's less efficient than existing databases? YOU DECIDE!

    Debaters:



    JAY M. WILLIAMS | LINKEDINFOUNDER, CTO & MANAGING PARTNER

    Jay has been a chief technology officer and consultant to many of the Global 2000. As a consultant he has developed a highly refined process for managing a company’’s technology infrastructure, including applications, security and network assets. Jay is a highly sought-after high performance computing architect and problem solver and has advised a number of high profile technology companies on their products. Jay is known for a rare combination of deep technology expertise, expert problem solving ability and business acumen. He is widely respected by peers and has influenced many pivotal technology consortia and industry steering groups. He regularly consults with senior technology and business executives and is frequently consulted by venture and capital investors for analyses of new technology strategies.


    Advisory Board Member, Austin Forum on Technology & Society

    Member, Austin Blockchain Collective

    Member, IEEE

    Contributor, The Open Group (ArchiMate and TOGAF) &The Linux Foundation (Hyperledger, Xen, Linux)



    JEFF KIRK | DELL


    WHAT IS THE BEST KIND OF BUSINESS TO START, B2B or B2C?

    Sailpoint, Spiceworks, BigCommerce, WP Engine. All big B2B companies that have been very successful in Austin. Titos, Deep Eddy, Localeur, Kendra Scott. All B2C companies that have also hit it big in Austin. So which is the best business to start here in Austin and which will bring you the most success. YOU DECIDE!

    Jason Ford, Hyping B2B 

    Chief Innovation Office at SaturnFive


    Jason was a geek in high school, but he was also creative and no one told him those two things could go together. So he studied jazz in college instead of computer science, and ended up with a career in digital marketing. After being encouraged by a friend to pursue entrepreneurship—something he had never really considered—he quit his job in 2009 to start a B2B tech company. His company, FeedMagnet, was ultimately acquired by Bazaarvoice in 2014. Jason has spent the past four years working with a number of startups as a mentor, operating partner, investor, and consultant. 

    Ikechi Nwabuisi, Defender of B2C 

    CEO of Tribl


    Nigerian American entrepreneur and former professional football player, Ikechi Nwabuisi, is the Founder of Tribl, a social messaging app for the culture! Ikechi was born and raised in Houston, TX and attended Northwestern University for his undergraduate and Masters.  After taking his best shot at the NFL and being cut twice he started his professional career with Merrill Lynch as a Wealth Manager. He eventually left that job to pursue tech and entrepreneurship while attending McCombs School of Business. He has worked with many of the accelerators here in town and is focused on making an impact in communities of color through technical innovation.

  description: >
    Cahoots, with sponsors Trove, Ann Arbor SPARK, the Zell Lurie Institiute at U of M, and the Entrepreneurship Center at WCC will be hosting a speaking engagement by author and blogger Ken Segall.

He worked directly with Steve Jobs for twelve years at both NeXT and Apple, led the creative team behind the Think different campaign that launched Apple's resurrection, and he started Apple down the i-road by naming the iMac. Ken's books Insanely Simple and Think Simple spell out the benefits of avoiding big company thinking and making complexity our enemy.

Participants need to register to have their sightings be included in the BIG YEAR JEFFCO official count. Participants will also need an eBird account. eBird is the online venue for documenting the birds participants see and will be the official site for recording BIG YEAR JEFFCO sightings.

    Nexus of Creative Science and The Marketplace: Partnerships That Work

    Alignment of basic scientific research with marketable products that meet a need occurs all too infrequently. Converting fundamental science in the laboratory into products and services that improve lives is challenging, usually requiring multidisciplinary partnerships between the public and private sectors. Please join Christopher Topp, Ph.D., Assistant Member and Principal Investigator, Danforth Center, and Warren Shafer, Ph.D., Vice President Global R&D and Regulatory Affairs, Valent Biosciences LLC, in a discussion of new ways in which Danforth Center science on biology of plant roots is informing commercial development of sustainable products for agriculture. Moderated by Vijay Chauhan, Global STL Lead at BioSTL, the discussion will focus on elements of successful partnerships between for-profit companies and not-for-profit research institutions, and how advanced imaging technologies are bridging the gaps between fundamental science and commercial applications.

  description: >2+




    The Data Center Austin Conference (DCAC) is more akin to South by Southwest (SXSW) for the data center industry, than your average run-of-the-mill data center conference. Just as SXSW helps “creative people achieve their goals,” likewise, DCAC helps bring the most relevant thought leaders in the data center industry under one roof, in order to collaborate, innovate, and motivate.

    These individuals will discuss what they are doing to support technological developments that are changing the world. 

    By understanding the current needs, investments, and visions of the most highly advanced tech companies such as Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, others in the industry can better equip themselves for tomorrow’s demands in technology.

Analysts can spend up to 60% of their time looking for data. This data needs to be not only relevant but also of sufficient quality. It has been trustworthy and safe to use. Good governance allows analysts to find data in keeping with regulatory compliance while breaking down interdepartmental silos towards a more egalitarian data estate. Waterline data catalog solves these foundational needs of analysts by making it easy for them to find the right data sets across the enterprise to use for their analysis in a safe and secure manner.\n \n\n\nExpert Panel\nPanelists: Ted Dunning, Anil Gadre, Keynote Speaker, Customer presenter \nTurn ideas from the day into your own practical course of action. This panel of experts applies the insights from the day’s sessions to real-world challenges by engaging the audience in a spirited discussion.\n\n\n\n\nPresented by:\n\n\nGold Sponsor:\n\n\nSilver Sponsor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORIZATION: By registering for this event, you are authorizing MapR to (i) provide contact information including your name, your company’s name, address, email address and phone number to MapR, MapR sponsors, the event center and any service vendor contracted to conduct work for the MapR Event, and (ii) contact you about MapR products and services.\n\n\n"

- name: 'Startup Milwaukee EMERGE August: Life Sciences'
  description: >-
    Milwaukee has a growing cluster of startups and established companies in the Life Sciences space. In August, we will highlight the growing Biotech ecosystem in Southeast Wisconsin.

    The event will feature a fireside chat with serial entrepreneur Tom Rehberger, who sold his most recent startup Agro Biosciences to Church & Dwight for over $100 million. When Rehberger co-founded Agro Biosciences in 2013, his plan was to focus on the human health aspects of probiotics. However, Agro Biosciences also developed a probiotic solution that met the needs of the poultry industry just as companies like Perdue Farms were phasing out antibiotics in chicken feed and hatcheries. Rehberger will be interviewed by Kathleen Gallagher, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and Executive Director of The Milwaukee Institute.

    Startups pitching at this event include:

    I did my PhD at Oxford in statistical theories of chemical reactions. After a brief stint as a high school teacher, I became a scientific analyst (what would now be called a data scientist), doing research to build machine learning models for the medical diagnostics industry. After moving to the US, I held various data and statistics roles at a couple of digital marketing startups. After coming to Galvanize to advance my python and SQL skills, I now work as a data scientist come manager for Cerebri AI Inc, where I get to work with a great team taking an innovative approach to measuring customer success.
