    The 2018 K-12 STEM Symposium

    It takes a community of teachers, mentors, parents and local leaders to nurture a child’s curiosity of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Linking science and mathematics taught in the classroom to impactful careers is an ongoing national challenge. This year’s Symposium will help children discover new and exciting possibilities in the STEM fields within the National Capital Region. Elementary, middle and high school students will learn about computer coding, space, 3D printing, drones, connected cars and healthcare through a wide range of fun and interactive exhibitors and speakers.

    High school and college internship opportunities can help students better understand exciting and wide-ranging careers available to those with STEM degrees. Summer and school-year STEM enrichment programs are a large part of a child’s interest in becoming proficient in the mathematics and sciences. Simple tools such as educational science and technology apps, family-friendly physics experiments and robotics building can also influence a child’s proficiently in the math and science.

    Special Thank You to our Presenting Sponsor Altamira Technologies 



     

    Quick Facts:



    This is the fifth year running since the initial STEM Symposium in 2014. We have only grown in size and diversity of age ranges, gender and race

    We project over 3,500 parents, kids and teachers to be in attendance

    Over 50 exhibitors from the business, government, academia and nonprofit sectors will be represented

    Exhibits include 3D printers, drones, flights simulators, physics experiences, heart monitors, topography models, puzzles and many robotics teams

    Over 20 local students will present top science fair projects before regional competition



    Mission and Outcome:

    The largest K-12 STEM Symposium in Northern Virginia, the Symposium provides the opportunity for students, parents and teachers in the National Capital Region (NCR) to interact with key business, education, non-profit and government leaders through real-life applications and presentations about how science, technology, engineering and mathematics impacts our community.

    Parents will be directed to a variety of K-12 STEM opportunities that exist in the National Capital Region.  From academic competitions, internships, after-school activities, special events, science and math enrichment courses, science fairs and more – parents remain in the driver seat of their child’s education.

    Industry leaders also have the opportunity to gauge the proficiency of the local STEM pipeline.

    Bottom Line:

    The opportunities for students who are STEM-proficient are endless. Connecting exciting career opportunities to math and science taught in the classroom is critical for encouraging and keeping children interested in pursuing STEM careers. Get informed. Get excited. Get started.

    The World's Largest DevOps Event,June 5 - 7, 2018at the Javits Center in New York, NY!

    The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.

    The @DevOpsSummit at Cloud Expo - to be held June 5-7, 2018, at the Javits Center in New York, NY - will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of enterprise IT professionals put out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.

    Join @DevOpsSummit Chair June 5-7 for three days of intense DevOps discussion and focus.

  description: >+
    Tickets go on sale March 1st, 2018 at 1:59 PM EST

     

    What is Stir Trek: 2018 Edition?

    Stir Trek: 2018 Edition is our tenth iteration for the Stir Trek conference. As before we're stirring web, mobile, client, and cloud development topics together along with quality, security, soft skills, design, and user experience content to present a fun day of learning. There will be eight tracks of sessions, breakfast, lunch, and a private screening of Avengers: Infinity War, which opens in theaters the day of the event - May 4th, 2018.



    What Topics Are Being Covered?

    The Stir Trek website lists the current Schedule, Sessions and Speakers that we have confirmed.



    What Does It Cost?

    In order to cover the significant costs of a large scale event like this one, there will be a $125 fee for attendance. This will be the best $125 you spend this year, however. Take a look at what you get.



    What Do I Get?

    It is our goal to bring you significantly greater value than your $125, and here’s how we intend to do it:


    Registration materials mailed ahead of event

    48 sessions of critical content

    Well-known regional and national speakers

    Lunch and Breakfast

    Attendee T-shirt

    Private screening of Avengers: Infinity War at the end of the day

    Refreshments during the movie



    How Many Tickets Can I Order at Once?

    Like previous years, you can order up to 20 tickets in one order.  If you need more than 20 tickets for your team, you will need to place multiple orders.  Please make sure that you include the appropriate name, address, and t-shirt size for each person you're buying a ticket for.  There's nothing more disappointing than receiving an awesome box from a conference and getting a shirt two sizes too small.



    How do I know what size t-shirt to order?

    We have creating sizing charts for our shirts to help you get a feel for which size will fit you best.  We offer both m

    en's and women's styles, so make sure you pick the cut that you prefer.




     Can I Buy Another Movie Ticket?

    Like our previous events we will be offering a limited sale of additional movie passes at a later date.  Registered conference attendees will be notified when additional movie passes are available for purchase.  Once these additional passes are sold out we can not offer any more.

    FAQs


    New location for 2018, where do I go?

    All activities for the weekend will be located at the Sheraton Baltimore North, on the first and second floor conference spaces.  Enter the hotel by the Conference Center doors, which will be clearly marked.  They are the doors immediately adjacent to the parking garage entry gate.  Registration will be right inside the doors, by the large video screen.  Venue maps will be placed on the event website.


    Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?

    There are no age limits for BSidesCharm 2018.  However, most, if not all material will be geared towards those over 16.  All children must have a badge and they must be accompanied by an adult guardian at all times.  There will be a Saturday night party at the hotel where you must be at least 21 to drink alcohol (ID will be required at the bar).


    What are my parking options at the event?

    If driving, there is a very large parking garage attached to the Sheraton Hotel.  Parking is available for $10.00/day.  Garage height is 6'6".


    Where can I stay Saturday night?

    We will have a block of discounted rooms at the Sheraton.  We will announce the reservation link via our website - www.bsidescharm.com.


    What can/can't I bring to the event?

    Please bring a positive attitude, a willingness to listen to others and a strong desire to learn.

    All forms of smoking (tobacco, vaping, e-cigs, etc.) are prohibited in the venue.  Designated smoking areas are available outside of the venue.

    The venue also requests that no outside food be brought into the conference spaces.


    What type of badge do I buy?

    The majority of attendees should choose a standard BSidesCharm badge.

    For those with Parallax electronic badges, which were sold last year, we will offer a new 2018 shield that can be attached to your electronic badge. Pick one or the other when buying your ticket. Please look for the option on the ticket page to select the electronic badge shield option. However, if you select the electronic badge shield, you are responsible for bringing a Parallax hackable electronic badge to BSidesCharm 2018.


    Will you have the Parallax electronic badges again?

    Electronic badges will not be available for purchase this year. If you choose the shield option when you buy your ticket, you will be provided with the 2018 shield at the registration table and then you must affix it to your Parallax badge. Electronic badge shields will only be available during online registration. We will not have any extra shields at the event. A shield by itself will not be considered a badge.


    Is my registration/ticket transferrable?

    Tickets may be transferred to others.  If possible, we ask that the original ticket holder log in and change the name on the ticket to match the new ticket holder.  It makes the check-in process flow much smoother.  Please note: if you registered for the 2018 electronic badge shield, the person you transfer the ticket to must have or obtain a Parallax electronic badge.


    Can I update my registration information?

    Yes, you may update registration information after it is entered. This includes changing the name on the ticket if the ticket is given to somebody else.


    Do I have to bring my ticket to the event?

    YES, please have a scanable ticket with you as you arrive at the venue.  You can print it out.  You can have the ticket pdf on your phone.  Just make sure that it is somewhere where we can scan it.  Present the ticket at the registration table to pick up your event badge and materials.


    What is the refund policy?

    Refunds will NOT be granted.  If you have a ticket that you no longer need, there will always be people looking for tickets.


    Who needs a badge?

    Everyone who wants to attend any of the BSidesCharm events, including the Saturday night party must obtain a 2018 badge.  Badges must be visible at all times within the event spaces.  Those refusing to wear an event badge will be asked to leave.


    What if I forget or misplace my badge?

    Replacement badges will be available at the registration table for a cash donation of $20 to one of the official BSidesCharm charities.  Details will be available at the registration table.


    Will you have t-shirts available this year?

    YES, we will have a brand new FREE 2018 BSidesCharm t-shirt available upon check in at registration.  In response to requests, we will be adding female sizes this year.  To make sure we order the correct number of t-shirts though, please select the appropriate size when purchasing your ticket.  If you do not want a t-shirt, that is perfectly fine.  Just select "no t-shirt" on the registration page.  We will also have a small number of current and past t-shirts available in the registration area starting Saturday afternoon.  It will be the same as last year, make a CASH donation to one or more of our official 2018 charities and you will receive the t-shirt of your choice.

- name: The Boston Pi Party
  description: >
    You’re Invited to a Boston Pi Party!

    Everyone has heard of the Boston Tea Party…get ready for the Boston Pi Party! Join fellow members of the Museum of Science community on March 10 at City Hall Plaza and be part of a new GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ attempt for the most shaving cream pies thrown at one time. The fun starts at 11:00 a.m. We’re looking for participants ages five years and up. The current record is 1,180, so we need 1,200 participants on City Hall Plaza to join in the fun and set a new world record!

    It’s all part of the Museum’s Pi Day Celebration. There’ll be science activities, local celebrities, and chances to win some fun Museum prizes! It is completely free to participate, though you can also make a gift to the Museum in honor of Pi Day.

    Sponsored by Gillette, Table Talk Pies, GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™, the City of Boston, and Magic 106.7.


    FAQs

    What is Pi Day?Pi Day is celebrated every year on March 14th. The Greek letter pi (π) is the symbol used in math to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter and is equal to approximately 3.14159.

    Why is the Museum of Science celebrating Pi Day?The Museum of Science is a world leader in STEM education – including mathematics. With over 1.4 million visitors to the Museum every year, we offer guests the chance to make life-changing discoveries and become engaged STEM learners.

    If Pi Day is March 14, why is this event on the 10th?We wanted to make sure that parents could bring their children to the event, so we’re planning to have it on a weekend. Come to the Museum of Science later that week on the 14th and enjoy an additional day of fun pi-themed events, including sunrise yoga classes and math-themed live programming.

    How many people can I bring?As many as you want! Each individual must sign a waiver on-site. Children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who can sign a waiver on their behalf.

    Can I bring children?Absolutely! This event is recommended for children ages 5 and up. Anyone under 18 must have a parent or guardian present who can sign a waiver on their behalf.

    Does it cost anything to participate?Participation is free. Event t-shirts are free with a donation of $31.41 to the Museum of Science. Copies of the new Guinness World Records: Science & Stuff book will also be available for purchase. This new page-turning book takes kids on a whirlwind tour through the astounding, record-breaking world (and universe) around us, while using remarkable records to examine fun facts, educational stats across subjects from physics to biology to astronomy, chemistry, and more.

    What can I bring to the event?There are currently no restrictions. However, we recommend you leave your bags at home. Shaving cream can get messy and we anticipate a big crowd at the event.

    Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?No. This registration page is intended to help the Museum and our sponsors get an idea of how many people are interested in attending, so we can make sure to have sufficient supplies and support staff.

    What are my transportation options?There is metered parking available in the area and several paid parking garages around City Hall. City Hall Plaza is also accessible via the MBTA. We recommend taking the green line to Government Center.

    Is there food available on-site?Yes! Several food trucks will be parked around City Hall Plaza and food will be available for purchase.

    What is the dress code?Shaving cream pies can get messy. We’ll provide ponchos and science goggles for protection, but we still recommend wearing something you won’t mind getting dirty.

    What if it rains? Or snows?Come on down anyway! The only thing that will stop this event is pouring rain, as we won’t be able to build the pies if the rain is too heavy. A light drizzle or some flurries won’t stop us.

    Where are you getting all these supplies from?Our event co-sponsors Gillette, Table Talk Pies, and the City of Boston have generously supplied the shaving cream, pie tins, and event space.

    What are you doing with all that stuff at the end of the event?We will be recycling the ponchos, pie tins, empty cans of shaving cream, and anything else leftover from the event. We have worked with Gillette’s scientists to ensure an environmentally friendly method for cleaning up any shaving cream left on the ground at the end of the event.

    Can I update my registration information?Yes, if you have an Eventbrite account. Once you’ve logged in, click on the My Tickets tab at the top of the screen, followed by View Order. Here, you can edit any information on your order.

    Will I get a confirmation e-mail?Yes, you will get a confirmation from Eventbrite. You will also get a reminder e-mail before the event.

    What if I can’t make the event on the 10th?Come to the Museum of Science on March 14! We have a wide program of events planned, including sunrise yoga classes, math-themed live programming, and our newest temporary exhibit, A Mirror Maze: Numbers in Nature. You can also make a gift to the Museum in honor of Pi Day.

    Show Dates and Times

    Shows are held at 7pm and 8:30pm every Friday throughout the winter term, except for March 16th.


    Ticket Availability

    40 seats will be available for reservation on Eventbrite at noon on the Sunday prior to a show. The remaining 20 seats will be available first-come first-serve at the door for walk-ins. If you reserve a seat please arrive with your ticket no later than 10 minutes before the show starts. We will release remaining open seats to the general public after this time.  Due to the dome-shaped ceiling we are truly limited in how many people can see the show.


    Parking Information

    The nearest WSU campus lot with visitor parking is lot 60; if you prefer a WSU parking garage, both garage 6 and 8 have visitor parking. See http://parking.wayne.edu/visitors/index.php for maps and fees

    On street parking is also available, the city charges $1.00 per hour and takes cash, credit cards, or you can use their mobile app ParkDetroit on your phone for payment.


    Finding the Planetarium on Wayne State University's Campus

    The planetarium is located on the lower lever of the Old Main building - the building with the clock tower on the corner of Cass and Warred Avenues in Detroit. If you enter through the main entrance on Cass Avenue, take the stairs down and walk straight ahead - you'll see the Planetarium murals and our double doors - room 0209.


    For Families

    On the second Saturday morning each month the planetarium offers a free show geared towards families with children 10 and under, our Young Astronomer's Show. While children are welcome at Friday night shows, they may prefer the  Young Astronomer's Show content. These shows last just about an hour, and may be best for young children who have trouble sitting quietly through a longer, more complex presentation.

    The planetarium can be reserved for private showings for school groups, scout troops, birthday parties or by other organizations for a fee. Please contact our staff for more information so we can help you design a show to meet your needs.

- name: Scientific Illustration from the Renaissance to the Digital Age Symposium
  description: "Imagining the Extraordinary:Scientific Illustration from the Renaissance to the Digital AgeSymposium\nMarch 15, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.March 16, 2018 | 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\nImagining the Extraordinary will explore how creative scientific illustration, often aided by advances in technology, has extended the reach of human understanding about the natural world. Knowledge about everything from the unimaginably large to the inconceivably small was initially nurtured by the popularity and availability of the printed image during and after the Renaissance. In a similar spirit of discovery, modern scientists have harnessed digital visualization techniques to nurture contemplation on everything from coral migration to the human genome.\nExploring the longstanding relationship between science and illustration, Imagining the Extraordinary will bring together historians, curators, artists, and librarians fluent in the visual vocabulary of the Renaissance and early modern period with modern scientists, technologists, and artists working in the same fields with new digital visualization tools. Scientific illustration provides a unique vantage from which to identify and discuss unifying concepts in scientific discovery, such as evidence and proof, artistic collaboration, imagining the unseen or the perplexing, and rendering images useful to multiple (and often skeptical) audiences. It is our hope that this symposium will provide an opportunity to bring together the many voices that have long been involved in condensing and animating the complexity of the natural world.\nRare Book and Special Collections Open HouseMarch 15, 2018 | 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.All ticketed guests of the \"Imagining the Extraordinary\" Symposium are invited to attend an open house and treasures display in the Library's Rare Book and Special Collections Division. \nTHE HEAVENS, 9:30-11:30\nRoger Gaskell: How books shaped the universe: the impact of the printed image Introduction by Caroline Duroselle-Melish\nPedro Raposo: Fathoming the heavens: size, scale, and depth in astronomical illustrations Introduction by Lilla Vekerdy\nKimberly Arcand: Exploring Hidden and Exotic Worlds: How Astronomical Data Transports Us Introduction by Stephanie Stillo\nTHE EARTH, 1:00-3:00\nKay Etheridge: Art and Science Intertwined Introduction by Leslie Overstreet\nTom Keegan:“Strong in Their Lowliness”: everyday people, everyday illustration Introduction by Nicki Saylor \nEleanor Lutz: Storytelling with Science Introduction by Kate Zwaard\n3:00-4:00 - Rare Book and Special Collection Division Open House  4:00-5:00 – Reception\n\nMarch 16\nTHE INSPIRED, 9:00-11:00\nLilla Vekerdy: Picturing Anatomy: Johannes de Ketham’s 1495 Book in Joyce Cutler-Shaw’s Hands (2004) Introduction by Michael North\nGreg Dunn: Self Reflected: Deeply fusing art and science to create the world's most complex artistic depiction of the human brain Introduction by Katherine Blood\nCatherine Newell: “To Believe Without Having Seen: Chesley Bonestell, Willy Ley, and the Invention of Outer Space” Introduction by Shelby Callaway\nCoffee Break\nTHE UNSEEN, 11:30-12:00\nVince Rossi: Unlocking knowledge in hidden collections Introduction by John Hessler\nClosing Remarks: 12:00-12:30\n\nImage: Master and Student from Lucidarius.

    THE TALK: Athletic Performance and Strength Training for Aging Populations

    Through his company, Power Athlete, John is able to focus on his true passion, foster and developing athleticism. Over the years, John has been fortunate to work with athletes of all ages and has had extensive experience working with aging populations of athletes. He breaks them down into categories based on chronological age and “training” age. The groups he is going to focus on in his talk are the under 50 athletes and over 50 athletes with and without an extensive training age. What can these two groups implement today that can help to keep fostering athleticism and keeping them fit for the years to come? How can they slow the hands of time by using methods found in the weight room and basic strength training to keeping fit and young? And what modalities can be added to any physical training routine to maximize progress and bridge the gap between aging and the desire to keep driving performance? How does nutrition, blood testing, sleep and movement come into play in keeping fit and young?

    John Welbourn is a 9-year veteran of the National Football League and CEO of Power Athlete. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a BA in Rhetoric and did did his masters work in Education at the University of California. While playing football at Berkeley, John was a four-year letterman.

- name: 'Trottier Symposium: Planning for Resiliency in the Face of Climate Change'
  description: "\nThe 5th annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy and Design\n\nPLANNING FOR RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nEngineering and design for sustainability are an essential part of a multi-faceted response to climate change particularly in urban centres, which may include increasing our resiliency in the face of extreme weather events, changing our water management practices, or adapting our cities and infrastructure to an unpredictable future. There is a need to identify robust strategies for responding to the challenges brought by climate change through adaptation, reorganization, and evolution. Our response to climate change must include solutions that allow our socio-ecological systems to not only survive, but thrive.\nThe 2018 5th Annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy, and Design will focus on resilience and human responses to the threats brought on by climate change, while considering the following questions:\n\nWhat is resilience and why is it so important to ensure sustainability in the context of urbanization and climate change?\nHow can we be more resilient to disruptions such as extreme weather events, floods, drought, sea level rise, and heat waves? What solutions are being imagined, developed, and implemented?\nHow can infrastructure be protected and self-renewed following extreme weather events or other stresses exacerbated by climate change?\n\n\nSpeakers\nThe symposium is a free, public event, featuring prominent speakers on each day of the 2 day event. \nApril 4th - Day 1 - 6pm to 8pm\nGuy Nordenson, Professor of Structural Engineering and Architecture, Princeton University School of Architecture\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nPippa Brashear, Director of Planning and Resilience, SCAPE\n\nDESIGNING FOR RESILIENCE: ECOLOGY + ENGINEERING + ENGAGEMENT\n\nTranslating the ideas of resilience into realizable actions and implementable designs can be challenging. We are forced to design with uncertain and incomplete information for an environment that is changing around us. However, the need for action and innovation is urgent, and success requires collaborative and interdisciplinary action. This presentation explores the process that has taken one innovative coastal resilience project from conceptual idea to the later stages of design and the lessons learned about integrating and implementing physical, ecological, and social resilience on the way.\n\n\n\nApril 5th - Day 2 - 6pm to 8pm\nKaren Seto, Professor of Geography and Urbanization Science, Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\n\nPhilippe Gourbesville, Professor Hydroinformatics and Water Engineering, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis\nRESILIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CITIES\nDuring the last decade, urban development has reached new submits with generation of mega cities that concentrates several millions of inhabitants. Those new urban environments represent unknown challenges for modern societies that are still using – implicitly or explicitly – the same concepts for urban development since millennia. Sustainability of urban centres is today a major priority that has to be approached in a holistic way. The size of cities requests to rethink and review some of the engineering concepts that are currently used and to shift from the centralized approach to the distributed and connected paradigm. At the same time, gradual sophistication of urban environment has generated a significant increase of global vulnerability regarding extreme weather events that are frequently affecting urban communities. \n\nMore Information: http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables\n\nVers une Stratégie de Résilience Face aux Changements Climatiques \n En matière de développement durable, l’ingénierie et la conception sont des éléments essentiels à une réponse multidimensionnelle au changement climatique, particulièrement dans les centres urbains. Il pourrait s’avérer nécessaire d’augmenter notre résilience dans le contexte des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, de changer nos pratiques de gestion des ressources en eau ou d’adapter nos villes et nos infrastructures pour faire face à un avenir imprévisible. Nous devons donc définir de solides stratégies pour répondre aux défis entraînés par les changements climatiques, grâce à l’adaptation, à la réorganisation et à l’évolution. Notre réponse aux changements climatiques doit comprendre des solutions qui permettront non seulement à nos systèmes socio-écologiques de survivre, mais également de prospérer.\nLe 5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables, édition 2018, porte principalement sur la résilience et les réponses humaines aux menaces qui découlent des changements climatiques, tout en se penchant sur les questions suivantes :\n\nQu’est-ce que la résilience et pourquoi est-il si important d’assurer la durabilité dans le contexte de l’urbanisation et des changements climatiques?\nComment pouvons-nous faire preuve d’une plus grande résilience aux perturbations comme les phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, les inondations, les périodes de sécheresse, l’élévation du niveau de la mer et les vagues de chaleur? Quelles solutions sommes-nous en train de concevoir, d’élaborer et de mettre en œuvre?\nComment pouvons-nous protéger les infrastructures et comment celles-ci peuvent-elles s’autorenouveler sous le coup des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes ou des autres stress aggravés par le changement climatique?\n\n\n\nConférenciers\n\nÉvénement public gratuit, le symposium présente des conférenciers de renom durant les deux jours du symposium. Les présentations seront données en anglais. \n  \n\n4 avril – 1re journée – de 18 h à 20 h\n\nGuy Nordenson, professeur, ingénierie structurale et architecture, école d’architecture de l’Université Princeton\nPippa Brashear, directrice de la planification et de la résilience, SCAPE\n \n\n5 avril – 2e journée - de 18 h à 20 h\n\nKaren Seto, professeure, géographie et études en urbanisme, école de foresterie et d’études environnementales de l’Université Yale \nPhilippe Gourbesville, professeur, hydro-informatique et ingénierie de l’eau, Université Nice-Sophia-Antipolis\n \nPour en savoir plus : http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n"

- name: Undoing the Future, a lecture by Karen Barad
  description: 'The indeterminacy of time-being at the core of quantum theory troubles the scalar distinction between the world of subatomic particles and that of social phenomena such as colonialism, capitalism, militarism, racism, nationalism and environmental destruction – all of which are entangled with nuclear and particle physics research. Quantum physics is a material-discursive practice with direct ties to the military-industrial complex, and while it gave birth to the atomic age, quantum physics disrupts classical Newtonian physics (which has its own troubled legacy in the service of war, colonialism, capitalist expansion, and empire building), including its foundational notions of space, time, and matter. In the annual Roslyn Silver ’27 Science Lecture, Karen Barad takes up quantum physics’ immanent deconstructive dynamics, consider ways in which quantum physics troubles modernist conceptions of time, and ask whether quantum temporalities might offer radical political imaginaries for cohabiting this planet more justly by undoing the future.Karen Barad is Professor of Feminist Studies, Philosophy, and History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, she co-directs the Science & Justice Graduate Training Program, funded by the National Science Foundation, which “trains science and engineering students alongside social science and humanities students to identify and respond to moments where research requires attentiveness to questions of policy, ethics, and justice.” She has a doctorate in theoretical partical physics and is the author of author of Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning.Details and AccessibilityThis event is free and open to the public. The venue is accessible to people with mobility disabilities. Please contact BCRW for additional accessibility needs.'

- name: 'Data Science in 30 Minutes: Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning with Spark Creator and Stanford Professor, Matei Zaharia'
  description: >-
    Join The Data Incubator and Databricks co-founder, Matei Zaharia, Ph.D for the next installment of our free online webinar series, Data Science in 30 minutes: Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning.

    Abstract:  Despite incredible recent advances in machine learning, building machine learning applications remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for all but the best-trained, best-funded engineering teams. This expense usually comes not from a need for new and improved statistical models but instead from a lack of systems and tools for supporting end-to-end machine learning application development, from data preparation and labeling to productionization and monitoring. In the Stanford DAWN project, we are developing a set of tools to make these processes easier, from weak supervision approaches to dramatically reduce the need for labeled data, to query-specific model specialization to reduce serving cost, and end-to-end ML systems that encapsulate a complete task and greatly simplify the interface to the user.
