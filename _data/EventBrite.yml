    Speaker: Dr Annie Hodgson, Department of Chemistry

    Department of Chemistry Open Lecture

    Some of the most amazing scientific discoveries have been made completely by accident. The sign of a great scientist is that they recognise the significance of what they observe; then led by curiosity and imagination experiment to develop an idea or invention. Whether the accident is the result of a clumsy cat or a careless chemist, serendipity has played an important role in the history of science. Dr Annie Hodgson will take you into the world of serendipitous discoveries and will try to recreate some of these accidents on purpose!

- name: 'Professor Joseph Silk: Dark Matters'
  description: >-
    The York Union warmly invites you to attend our second external speaker event of 2019 as we welcome Professor Joseph Silk for an address titled:

    'Dark Matters.' 

    The emergence of cosmic structure is an outcome of the Big Bang that we study by peering back through the mists of time with giant telescopes to extract knowledge about the most remote objects in the Universe. One of the greatest mysteries in the cosmos is that it is extremely dark. Not only is the night sky mostly dark, but also most of the matter  in the universe is dark. For every atom visible in planets, stars and galaxies today there is about six times more matter in some invisible form. The Universe not only contains dark matter but its mass budget is dominated by even more mysterious dark energy. This is acts like antigravity, and has accelerated the rate of cosmic expansion in the recent past. Professor Silk will describe the dark side of the Universe, how we measure it, and why it matters.

    Professor Silk is an astrophysicist and a leading expert on the early Universe. He is a Balzan Prize winner and one of the world’s most sought-after science communicators. He is a research scientist at the Service d’Astrophysique, CEA, Saclay and the Institut d’Astrophysique, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris,  Homewood Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and Senior Fellow in the Beecroft Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford. 

    Professor Silk is also the Gresham Professor of Astronomy and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He is one of the world’s leading researchers into theoretical cosmology, dark matter, galaxy formation and cosmic microwave background. Having delivered some of the most important invited astronomy lectures around the globe and with over 500 publications to his name, he is one of the world’s foremost science communicators. His books include: The Big Bang, Horizons of Cosmology, The Infinite Cosmos, On the Shores of the Unknown, A Short History of the Universe and Cosmic Enigmas.

    The address will include a Q&A during which time audience members can pose questions to Professor Silk. Our events are as intelligent as our audience so please join us for what should be a lively and engaging evening!

    Please bring your free ticket with you to the event. You cannot be guaranteed entry without your ticket and those without tickets may be allowed entry only if spaces are available.

    To cover the expenses of hosting this event we suggest a small donation of £2 from students and £4 from members of the public at the door for those who are able. The York Union is a strictly not-for-profit organisation run by a small group of volunteers.

  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Clive Lipchin, Arava Institute, Israel

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    The Middle East is one of the world’s most water scarce regions, but also has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. That means water demand is fast outstripping supply and climate change impacts will only exacerbate the issue. Despite this dire reality, Israel today has a water surplus, and has successfully decoupled itself from the vagaries of diminishing freshwater supplies.

    In this presentation Dr Lipchin will discuss how Israel went from a water scarce to a water abundant country. He will discuss the implementation of successful technologies, the government policies and economics that encourage the adoption of a water smart country, and a culture that encourages and supports innovation and conservation. He will also discuss how Israel can leverage its water abundance for regional cooperation and stability.

- name: Should we be worried about indoor air pollution?
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Nic Carslaw, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    In developed countries, we have been estimated to spend about 90% of our time indoors, for instance at home, at work, or commuting between the two. It therefore follows that our exposure to air pollution, whether to pollutants generated indoors or outdoors, happens mainly in the indoor environment. This presentation will introduce the audience to the many ways in which we can be exposed to air pollution indoors, including through activities such as cooking or cleaning. The presentation will finish with some methods for reducing our exposure to pollution indoors as well as some to avoid, along with some thoughts on future issues for indoor air quality.

    The VIVIT Experience is a nationally award winning academic experience offering you the chance to participate in a recreated post mortem experience conducted on VIVIT -the worlds only semi-synthetic human cadaver. During this special 5 hour experience you will be taken on a scientifically accurate recreated human body dissection learning in-depth anatomy and physiology relevant to your academic studies. The course is interactive and designed to support those students currently at York St John University and the surrounding areas studying in the biosciences, health, sports or associated degree pathways that require an understanding of advanced anatomy and physiology or indeed the associated clinical pathologies. The procedure will be lead by Samuel Piri & team who will first set out the basics of anatomical dissection before systematically working their way through the anatomical cavities comparing normal specimens with various states of pathology. You will also be taught a variety of important clinical skills including interpreting X-rays and linking symptoms to clinical diagnosis. There will be the opportunity to ask questions and at the same time handle the anatomical samples and even the chance to undertake some dissection for yourself.

    There is 1 experience operating on the 18th May in York A daytime experience operating between 10.00am and 3.00pm. Please ensure you purchase tickets for the correct experience as changes cannot be made.

    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of January 2019 confirmed speakers and workshops include pioneers from organisations such as Complexiti, NHS, QinetiQ, Illuminate Technologies, YHROCU and the National Spectrum Centre. Areas to be explored include gene therapy, scientific policy making, future applications of technology (5G, for instance) and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

    Notably, we're excited to be partnered with Supporting Women in Science (SWIS) and will be hosting a riveting and relevant panel discussion 'Women in Stem - Challenges & Opportunities', designed to break through to the key points of view and move the conversation forwards. 

    To conclude the event, we will be hosting a networking drinks evening to which all delegates will be welcomed warmly, to discuss key insights from the day, forge long-lasting connections and enjoy good company. 



    FAQ:



    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. As there will be a drinks evening with alcohol, we will be expecting guests who are fortunate enough to look under 21 to provide proof-of-age where requested.

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Facebook: facebook.com/YorkScienceConference --> Feel free to message us, we respond rapidly!

    LinkedIn: York Science Conference --> This is our more corporate platform, we're happy to receive questions/thoughts through this medium though.

This is an exciting opportunity to hear Simon speak about ask him questions about his work.  \nHagge Woods Trust was founded in 2013 with the creation of its flagship site Three Hagges Wood-Meadow near York.  The ecosystem and the wood-meadow community of volunteers and Friends are flourishing.  Without the invaluable support of many individuals, Trusts and Foundations, and businesses in the community, Hagge Woods Trust would be unable to sustain its ground-breaking work in restoring nature through the creation of wood-meadows and educating children and families about native nature and wildlife.  \nDrinks reception is included in the ticket price.\nSponsored by Andrew Jackson Solicitors LLP, CGA Accountants and Wrapped Brand and Digital Agency."
