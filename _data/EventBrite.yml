- name: 'Artificial Intelligence: Promises and Perils - Focus Day'
  description: >-
    The £12m Assuring Autonomy International Programme is spearheading research, training and standards in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS). Our vision is to further enable the widespread and beneficial uptake of RAS by overcoming the obstacles to achieving regulatory and public acceptance.

    Do you know what artificial intelligence (AI) is? Would you like to find out more? Join us to discuss what we should and shouldn’t be worried about, and what AI might mean for our future health, employment and everyday life. As well as inspiring talks from experts, our Focus Day includes opportunities to chat with artificially intelligent agents.

    11am to 4.30pmExhibitionExplore AI, robotics and autonomous systems: Have a chat with a chatbot; see robots in action and have a go at programming your own; or play noughts-and-crosses against the computer and watch its ‘thought processes’.

    11am to 11.45amWhat is Artificial Intelligence?Our keynote address introduces you to the world of artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems. Find out about the robots that are already here and part of our lives, and discover what the future may hold.

    12 noon to 1.30pmDriverless VehiclesDriverless vehicles have been hitting the headlines – autonomous cars, crew-less tankers and parcel delivery by drones. They promise improved freedom and efficiency, but how do we live safely in a world of AI?

    2.30pm to 4pmArtificial Intelligence for HealthWould you choose to be looked after by a robotic carer? Could AI be used to support those with mental health issues? Is the potential for AI to revolutionise healthcare overhyped or could it transform the NHS?

    4.30pm to 6pmThe Future of WorkIn the near future, autonomous systems will be placed in roles and given functions currently performed by skilled humans. We discuss the implications for the world of work.

- name: 'Professor Martin Hendry: Ripples of Gravity, Flashes of Light'
  description: >-
    The first ever direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations, from the collision of two massive black holes more than a billion light years away, has been widely hailed as the biggest scientific breakthrough of the decade, and led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics to three senior LIGO scientists and pioneers: Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.  August 2017 then saw another spectacular discovery – as for the first time gravitational waves and light were detected from the same cosmic source: a pair of colliding neutron stars 130 million light years distant. Join LIGO scientist Professor Martin Hendry as he explores the amazing technology behind the detection of gravitational waves, and what their discovery might soon tell us about some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics and astronomy.

    Martin Hendry is Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Glasgow, where he is currently Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. He is a senior member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, for which he chairs the LSC Education and Public Outreach Group.

    The Interactive Media Showcase, as part of the annual LUMA festival at the University of York, is organised by students on the BSc in Interactive Media degree programme. It is a showcase designed to show off the sheer variety of skills and talent that the course has to offer. The event has been entirely student-led, with a group of dedicated students working over the past months to organise, promote and develop the event. The showcase will be a great opportunity not only to see what the students on the course are capable of but to meet the talent and engage in an exciting community of students.

    There will be something for everyone at the event, from Critical and User Experience Design pieces to Virtual Reality experiences and humanities dissertation pieces. All of which have been selected to show the very best of what the students are capable. All of the work being showcased will be pieces that have been submitted for previous assignments, showing the calibre and expected quality of work that the students are expected to deliver.  The evening will take place on the University’s Campus East within the Department of Theatre, Film and Television and welcomes those who are excited to see the future of media and mass communication.

- name: Impossible futures? Environmental utopias
  description: >-
    For the last 50 years environmentalism has warned of the dire consequences of abusing and exploiting the planet’s resources, conjuring future wastelands of chaos. But it has also generated rich new ideas about how humans might live better with nature. Using examples from science fiction and popular nonfiction texts, Lisa Garforth of Newcastle University explores what green hopes for the 21st century might look like.

- name: Binding Blocks Student Training Workshop 2018
  description: >
    Join the Department of Physics at the Unviversity of York for a Binding Blocks training day for nuclear physics communication: open to all physics postgraduate students from any institution and to undergraduates studying physics at the University of York.  

    This half day student workshop will focus on student training in public engagement, in particular preparing participants for practical publican engagement in nuclear physics in a way that is both research linked and matched to the nuclear physics curriculum of secondary education in the UK. This is facilitated through the construction and engagement with the 7-metre Binding Blocks nuclear chart built from LEGO-bricks, in combination with interactive workshops on nuclear astrophysics and other areas of nuclear physics, including workshops available for Nuclear Masterclasses and engaging activities when discussing nuclear physics with the public.


    The workshop programme will include:


    Engagement with a Binding Blocks Nuclear Masterclass.

    Student presentations on schools workshops.

    Overview of the UK secondary-education curricula. 

    Communicating Science and STEM-ambassador induction.



    The programme will be presented jointly between students who have engaged with the programme in the past, academics from the University of York, as well as science communicators from both University of York and the National STEM Learning Centre.

    The workshop will thereby focus on sharing and developing expertise in public engagement among PhD students and undergraduate students. The workshop will include interactive engagement with nuclear physics and will prepare participants for subsequent public engagement, for example during Nuclear Masterclasses, public events, public talks, schools engagement, or engagement in teacher training. This includes, the planned Binding Blocks programme at York and other UK universities during June-September 2018.

  description: >-
    Bones – imaging prehistoric and modern women

    Dr Alison Macintosh, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge

    Human bones are highly adaptable, tailoring their size and shape in response to the conditions to which they are exposed during growth and adulthood. Because of this adaptability during life, human skeletal remains can provide a wealth of information about the living conditions and behaviour patterns of men and women in the past. However, interpreting that information can be challenging, and we don’t yet have a good understanding of how women’s bones in particular reflect developmental and behavioural factors. This talk outlines the ways in which we are using cutting-edge imaging technologies and the study of living athletes to better understand variation in women’s bone strength, as well as body size, muscle, and fat, and what this new information means for more richly reconstructing prehistoric women’s lives from skeletal remains. 

    This research was funded by the European Research Council, grant agreement n.617627′ and an ERC Starting Grant (ERC-2010-StG263441). The event is hosted by Yorkshire Philosophical Society.

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites'
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

- name: 'OR Society Online Resource Training: Maths is Fundamental'
  description: >-
    Want to encourage school pupils to engage with maths but not sure how? 

    Maths skills are vital in the field of operational research (OR), where techniques such as problem structuring methods and mathematical modelling are used to analyse complex business situations.

    The OR Society has developed a series of workshops for school groups aged 11-16 years to support maths learning in the classroom. The workshops engage pupils in fun activities that are directly connected to the National Curriculum, building analytical skills and showcasing careers in which these skills are essential. 

    If you are a STEM Ambassador or a member of the OR Society, please join us for a free training session provided by the OR Society and learn how to deliver two popular maths workshops:

    Playing with LEGO

    This session uses LEGO to engage students by building tables and chairs and get them thinking about the different ways and number of combinations available, given a limited number of bricks. This then leads them to develop the most efficient way to build table and chairs if squares and rectangles cost different amounts, and chairs and tables sell for different amounts. The material uses algebra, formulating equations, solving and graphing inequalities, addition and subtraction.

    Playing Snakes and Ladders - Climbing the Career Ladder  

    The aim of this pack is to introduce students to one of the topics of O.R. in a fun and engaging way. It uses a specially designed board game to engage students by moving around the board and exploring the different careers and opportunities available to maths students. Perhaps you become a mathematical comedian and move forwards 4 spaces, or perhaps you buy the wrong plane for BA and move back 2 spaces! This then leads onto how a board game is designed, flow charts and the algorithms behind it. 

    Please register in advance if you wish to attend this training session. Refreshments will be provided to keep you going!


    Find out more here  about how OR Society volunteers offer education outreach to schools.
