- name: Climate change, health impacts and health and social inequalities in the UK
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Jouni Paavola, University of Leeds

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    Professor Paavola's talk examines how social and health inequalities shape the health impacts of climate change in the UK, and what the implications are for climate change adaptation and health care provision.  The talk will draw from the work Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) commissioned for the Climate Change Report Card on the key health impacts of climate change in the UK.

    Altered exposure to heat and cold, air pollution, pollen, food safety risks, disruptions to access to and functioning of health services and facilities, emerging infections and flooding are the key impacts of climate change influencing health outcomes in the UK. Professor Paavola suggests that age, pre-existing medical conditions and social deprivation are the key factors that make people vulnerable and to experience more adverse health outcomes related to the climate change impacts. For this reason, climate change, aging population and decreasing public spending on health and social care may aggravate the inequality of health outcomes related to climate change in the UK in the future.

    Health education and public preparedness measures that consider the differential exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different groups could help address health and social inequalities to do with climate change. In contrast, adaptation strategies based on individual preparedness, action and behaviour change may actually aggravate health and social inequalities due to their selective uptake, unless they are coupled with broad public information campaigns and financial support for undertaking adaptive measures.

    Speaker: Dr Annie Hodgson, Department of Chemistry

    Department of Chemistry Open Lecture

    Some of the most amazing scientific discoveries have been made completely by accident. The sign of a great scientist is that they recognise the significance of what they observe; then led by curiosity and imagination experiment to develop an idea or invention. Whether the accident is the result of a clumsy cat or a careless chemist, serendipity has played an important role in the history of science. Dr Annie Hodgson will take you into the world of serendipitous discoveries and will try to recreate some of these accidents on purpose!

- name: 'From scarcity to abundance: How water resource management can contribute to cooperation and stability in the Middle East'
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Clive Lipchin, Arava Institute, Israel

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    The Middle East is one of the world’s most water scarce regions, but also has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. That means water demand is fast outstripping supply and climate change impacts will only exacerbate the issue. Despite this dire reality, Israel today has a water surplus, and has successfully decoupled itself from the vagaries of diminishing freshwater supplies.

    In this presentation Dr Lipchin will discuss how Israel went from a water scarce to a water abundant country. He will discuss the implementation of successful technologies, the government policies and economics that encourage the adoption of a water smart country, and a culture that encourages and supports innovation and conservation. He will also discuss how Israel can leverage its water abundance for regional cooperation and stability.

- name: Should we be worried about indoor air pollution?
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Nic Carslaw, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    In developed countries, we have been estimated to spend about 90% of our time indoors, for instance at home, at work, or commuting between the two. It therefore follows that our exposure to air pollution, whether to pollutants generated indoors or outdoors, happens mainly in the indoor environment. This presentation will introduce the audience to the many ways in which we can be exposed to air pollution indoors, including through activities such as cooking or cleaning. The presentation will finish with some methods for reducing our exposure to pollution indoors as well as some to avoid, along with some thoughts on future issues for indoor air quality.

    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of September 2018, confirmed speakers will explore areas such as gene therapy, scientific policy making and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

     

    FAQ:


    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. 

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Facebook: facebook.com/YorkScienceConference --> Feel free to message us, we respond rapidly!

    LinkedIn: York Science Conference --> This is our more corporate platform, we're happy to receive questions/thoughts through this medium though.

- name: N8 CIR Humanities Roadmap - York
  description: >2-

    N8 CIR aims to support the strategic research objectives of the N8 universities by building communities of practice around selected N8 strategic research priorities. Five priorities (themes) were identified in 2018 by the N8 Strategic Executive Group (N8 SEG) for N8 CIR to tackle. In the first instance N8 CIR will concentrate primarily on two themes – Digital Health and Digital Humanities.

    A research roadmap will be developed for each theme in conjunction with the research community; the roadmap will identify key opportunities where N8 CIR could help to accelerate progress within that theme. N8 CIR will use the skills and expertise of research software engineers (RSEs) already working within the N8 to resolve bottlenecks and challenges faced by researchers aiming to target these research opportunities.
