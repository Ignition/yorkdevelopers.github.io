- name: 'The Central PA RUG Meeting: Streamline Project Management with Bluebeam'
  description: "Collaboration is the new buzz word as construction projects become increasing complex in dealing with numerous parties through conception, design, and building. This month’s meeting will provide an overview of the software tool Bluebeam and how it facilitates working with all the different entities within a construction project.\nFrom the design perspective, you will learn how you can host virtual meetings that enable remote project partners from across time zones to collaborate online – in real time. Replicate a conference room setting, but instead of face-to-face, do it in a digital environment.\nYou will also learn how you can export your 3D design from Revit to create a 3D PDF. See how you can mark-up the PDF to easily communicate with others in the project chain who don’t have access to Revit.\nMoving from design to construction, learn how the presenter’s company leverages Bluebeam for real-time, in-the-field communication. Construction teams have immediate access to the most up-to-date plans. RFIs are answered more quickly reducing costly down time.\nRegister by December 11th to attend in person or tune-in virtually.\n       Doug Galloway Erdman Anthony Senior Mechanical Designer   \n"
