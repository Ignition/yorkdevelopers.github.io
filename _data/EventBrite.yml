- name: Measuring ability in generic skills - should we and can we?
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Tony Ward, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Department of Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lectures

    In relation to generic skills, Higher Education faces two fundamental questions: Should we be measuring the ability of students?; and secondly if we should, can we? The talk starts with the "should we" by looking at a model of the student first employment transition and what industry declares it needs. Some current research into the analysis of job adverts tells an interesting story in terms of what skills are sought by industry and, more interestingly how level of ability is articulated. The talk then addresses the obvious question of what are the generic skills and discusses the complexities in terminology and definitions. It then turns to the second question of can we measure ability in generic skills and discusses issues of accuracy, reliability, rater bias and fatigue and certification in relation to public speaking as an examplar. The conclusion? Should we and can we? Come along and find out some of the things that affect our ability to answer these questions and do anything.

    Speaker biography:  Tony joined the Department of Electronics on the 1st January 1993 as a lecturer in Business Management after 18 years in Industry as an electronic design engineer, technical manager and programme manager for a number of different companies in the UK and US. Within York he has held the position of Provost of Alcuin College and Director of the Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Enterprise. Externally he has been President of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering and managed or participated in over 20 research projects. His research is in area of Engineering Education and Entrepreneurship with a specific focus on exploring the development and assessment of generic skills.

- name: Building a better computer
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Jim Austin, Department of Computer Science

    Computer Science Lectures

    Building computers is a complex task, relatively inefficient, resulting in power hungry systems that untrained individuals cannot alter without some risk to the computer and to themselves. There must be a better way to do this that would make lives easier for everyone.

    Jim Austin has been working on a new concept in computing for over 17 years. Inspired by his immense collection of computers (www.computermuseum.org.uk) he felt it was time to take a fresh look at how we physically build a computer system – this has involved him in a wide range of subjects including, Computer Architectures, Computer networking, 3D topology, chemistry, 3D printing, Manufacturing, Design, physics – a fascinating and challenging journey.

    The idea stems from the basic concept of removing everything from the computer apart from the chips that drive it. The solution started out with a small plastic ball containing the chip which communicates and is powered without wires – throw a pile of balls into bucket and you have your computer – A Ball Computer (ABC).

    The practical conclusion of the ABC idea resulted in the COOL Computer, which will be demonstrated and the story of the journey in reaching the practical solution presented.

    Speaker: Dr Avtar Matharu, Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence

    One Planet Week

    For all the good that Chemistry brings us, it is still very much misconstrued as dirty, polluting and harmful.  This image is often referred to as ‘brown or red’ chemistry and is gradually changing for the better to a variety of shades of green, encompassing sustainability and circularity. 

    This talk will give examples of turning waste into resource, promoting cradle to cradle rather than cradle to grave thinking, and will highlight global opportunities and barriers to development of Circular Economies.

    Visiting Professor David Rogers Inaugural Lecture

    Professor David Rogers discusses future trust in the internet of things and connected economies, and how to help prevent artificial intelligence systems from easily being gamed by adversaries.

    5pm: Drinks Reception 5:30pm - 6:30pm: Lecture and Q&A'The real world is not real: manipulation of data and people in the future internet'

    In the future, how will it be possible to trust anything at all? What we read, what we see and what we do – how will we know that any of it is real? How will we prove that something is false or that we didn’t do something?

    Current “trusted” systems based on collective ratings are manipulated on a wholesale basis, with services to perform this available to anyone prepared to pay. From products, to restaurant reviews and endorsements, our perceptions are being twisted by falsehoods which are sometimes algorithmically generated; pictures can be manipulated and false data trails created relatively easily.

     Combined with the use of so-called “dark patterns”, rudimentary artificial intelligence is already shaping what we do, nudging humans into behaviours that are desired by the shepherds of such automated systems.

     As our future shifts to one which humans delegate management of data gathering, leaving machines to trust data from other machines, which in turn lead to machine-based decision trees based on that data, how quickly can manipulation of critical elements of what is relied upon be turned into economic disaster?

  description: >
    ***This event is free for all students and staff from the University of York and University of York St John; email enterprise@york.ac.uk for the discount code***




    Want to make a video game? 

    Learn how by joining the York Game Jam as part of Global Game Jam 2018! Bring along your friends and make a game together, or come and meet new friends.


    How does it work?

    You'll be set a theme for the game on the Friday evening (26th January). Then, over the course of 48 hours you and your fellow team mates will rapidly go through each stage of game development in crunchtime fashion. This covers everything from theme development through to music, artwork and programming. When the deadline hits you will have a fully playable game!

    Industry experts will be coming along on both the Saturday and Sunday to play your games and give you hints and advice!


    No code experience? No problem.

    Whether you're an industry veteran or a total beginner, anyone is welcome to try their hand at making a game – no code experience is required (although having computer skills helps, and we're sure you've got those!).


    ***Introductory workshop***


    In preparation for the Game Jam, we will be running the following workshops on GameMaker (focussing on 2D games) and the Unity game engine (focussing on 3D games). Tickets will be made available for these once times and venues have been confirmed.


    GameMaker Beginners (Time and Location TBC)

    Never made a game before? No programming experience? No problem. An industry insider will take you through the basics. Be sure to bring your laptop with you, and have GameMaker pre-installed (free version available online). Note: Windows OS only.

    Unity Workshop - (Time and Location TBC)

    This workshop will cover setting up a project through to moving a character around a 3D virtual environment. Previous experience with either C# or JavaScript would be ideal, but prior experience in other programming languages should suffice. Be sure to bring your laptop with you, and have Unity pre-installed (free version available online).


    What do I need to bring?

    Bring your laptops, your friends and your curiosity. Don't forget to bring refreshments to keep up your energy levels, bearing in mind, though, that you're not in any way expected to work through the night. Sleep is a beautiful thing.

    We recommend that you download the software you'd like to use in advance of the Game Jam so you're ready to go. If you're not sure of what you’ll need, see thesuggestions on the Game Jam website.


    Sounds fun?
