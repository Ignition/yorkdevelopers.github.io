- name: 'Getting in the Neural Groove: Neuroscientific Perspectives on Dance'
  description: >-
    If you’re interested in dance or psychology don’t miss this exciting event.

    In this interactive event, Prof. Emily Cross from the University of Glasgow explores what the latest neuroscience research reveals about what’s going on inside our heads as we watch dancers that inspire us to get out of our seats and feel the groove.

    Prof. Emily Cross is the professor of Social Robotics at University of Glasgow’s institute of Neuroscience and Psychology. Social robotics concentrates on the development and design of robots which interact socially with humans. Emily’s team has been focusing on the psychology behind highly skilled motor functions, such as dance, music, gymnastics, contortion, and acrobatics.
