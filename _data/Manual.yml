Drinks, food, and more drinks provided as always by our wonderful sponsors - Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Inviqa, QuidCo, and Futurelabs!</p> <p><b>Timings</b></p> <p>• 18:30 – Turn up, have a drink, a snack, and a chat (pizza, beer, coffee, soft drinks)</p> <p>• 19:00 – “<b>Love and Hate relationship between ORMs and Query Builders</b>” - Romans Malinovskis</p> <p>• 19:45 – Mid session interval</p> <p>• 19:55 –  “<b>Building a REPL for Phunkie, with Phunkie</b>” – Marcello Duarte</p> <p>• 20:30 – Pop over the road to Headrow House pub (a drink or two provided)</p> <p><b>Love and Hate relationship between ORMs and Query Builders</b> - Romans Malinovskis</p> <p><i>While some developers prefer writing their own SQL queries, others prefer to abstract the database with Object Relational Mappers. Is there a middle-ground that incorporates both without compromising and resulting in limitations?</i></p> <p><i>This talk will focus on database abstraction, query latency &amp; domain model and persistence mapping patterns in PHP applications. It will introduce the core concepts behind “Agile Data” - (database abstraction library available under MIT from <a href=\"http://github.com/atk4/data\">github.com/atk4/data</a>).</i></p> <p>Romans is an author of “Agile Data” and an active PHP / SaaS developer since 1997.</p> <p>Romans Malinovskis on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/romaninsh\">@romaninsh</a></p> <p><b>Building a REPL for Phunkie, with Phunkie</b> – Marcello Duarte</p> <p><br/><i>After writing PhpSpec using PhpSpec, I decided my latest project should be writing a REPL for Phunkie – my PHP functional structures library – using Phunkie itself, along with functional programming patterns and techniques.</p> <p>This talk will share my learnings. We’ll go through the code, understand the design, and learn how to apply some of the Functional Programming (FP) principles in a real-life scenario. We’ll go beyond the basics and look at how FP deals with state, composition, and side-effects like IO, validation, and more.</p> <p>We’ll also discuss the benefits and costs of the functional approach. You will leave this session with an appetite to learn even more about what FP, and in particular FP in PHP with Phunkie, has to offer.</i></p> <p>Marcello is a co-creator of PhpSpec and the Head of Training at Inviqa</p> <p>Marcello Duarte on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_md\">@_md</a></p> <p><b>Sponsors</b></p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support of this community event.</p> <p><a href=\"http://futurelabs.org.uk/\">Futurelabs</a></p> <p> – Are a not-for-profit formed to help provide a focal point for tech start-up and scale-up businesses in and around Leeds.

It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> '

  description: "<p>After an excellent start to our 2017 talks schedule we are delighted to announce our second Leeds event of the year.</p> <p>We have two great guest speakers so come along and enjoy the talks.</p> <p><b>Session One: I am a Business Analyst and so are you!</b></p> <p>Mairead O'Connor, Delivery Manager, Equal Experts</p> <p>Description: \"Some are specialists, some are generalists, but we all do business analysis. The whole team is responsible for figuring out what’s needed to solve a problem. No ‘chucking it over the fence’, no ‘I’m waiting to get the requirements’, no ‘that wasn’t written on the card’. Let’s talk about how we can collaborate to develop great products.\"</p> <p><b>Session Two: The Rise of the Agile Architect</b></p> <p>Reda Hmeid, Technical Architect, Equal Experts</p> <p>Description: \"Architecture and Agile have had a fractious relationship since the latter was introduced to the world in 2001. In fact, there has been a constant argument that architects are no longer needed in the Agile world. </p> <p>However, architects working in an Agile way have been around for years, with unequivocal success. Long before the Agile Manifesto was signed.</p> <p>Here, we'll go through the characteristics and attributes of the Agile Architect that has seen them rise to prominence in recent years.\"</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be provided as usual.</p> "
