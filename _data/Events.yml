We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The talks</p> <p>✩ Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns (@SamBurnsUK)</p> <p>This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture. Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages. We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.</p> <p>✩ Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell (@JasonBruce88)</p> <p>Starting as a Junior Developer can be both exciting and overwhelming.

- name: The Game Has Changed with Jeff Patton
  description: "<p>About the session</p> <p>We all know how fast technology changes. But, we sometimes fail to understand how fast our process needs to change to keep up. This talk is about how 21st century software development has thrown out most of the process assumptions you might have originally learned. In this talk, Jeff Patton will explain how Product Thinking, Lean Startup Thinking, and Continuous Delivery has fundamentally changed how we design and build software.</p> <p>Agenda for the evening:</p> <p>● 18:30 - Networking, food and drinks<br/>● 19:00 - Talk<br/>● 20:15 - More networking and drinks<br/>● 20:30 - Departure</p> <p>About Jeff</p> <p>Jeff makes use of over 20 years of product design and development experience to help companies create great products.</p> <p>Jeff started in software development in the early 90s as a project leader and senior developer for a small software product company. There he learned that well written code, and fast delivery isn’t the secret to success, it’s just table stakes. It’s actually deep understanding of your customers and users coupled with a desire to create a product that’s really valuable to them that makes the biggest difference.</p> <p>In 2000 Jeff worked as a product manager at one of the first companies adopting Extreme Programming. It was there he built a strong appreciation for the discipline that Agile thinking brings to software development and a deep concern for what seemed to be left out, specifically good product thinking. Since then Jeff has been an evangelist championing the inclusion of strong product design and user experience practice in Agile development. Today Jeff teaches and coaches a contemporary blend of practice that incorporates Lean and Lean Startup and Design Thinking all directed at helping organizations build products their customers love.</p> <p>Jeff’s a Certified Scrum Trainer, and winner of the Agile Alliance’s 2007 Gordon Pask Award for contributions to Agile Development. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.</p> <p>User Story Mapping - Book Giveaway</p> <p>We'll be giving away a copy of Jeff's excellent \"User Story Mapping\" book to a lucky person picked at random on the night at the meetup.</p> <p>*agileYork supports <a href=\"http://diversitycharter.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://diversitycharter.org</a> *</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

  description: '<p>Mikes James, Microsoft Cloud advocate from Microsoft: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/micjames/" class="linkified">https://www.linkedin.com/in/micjames/</a> will be coming to speak with us about the recently announced Mobile backend as a service offerings in App Center. He will augment this with Logic Apps to power a Xamarin Forms app. The app itself has some new features from the latest 4.0 release, including the new CollectionView.</p> <p>Visual Studio App Center allows developers to ship better apps through a suit of functions including automated builds, testing, crash and analytics reporting as well as push notifications. I’ll quickly cover these existing features before moving onto to showing two new preview features released earlier this year; authentication and data.</p> <p>The addition of Authentication and Data to App Center takes it from a DevOps tool to a fully fledge Mobile Backend as a Service! This session has been created to help you understand you can get started with the new features in the context of Xamarin.Forms. I’ll also show how you can extend the functionality through Azure Logic Apps to create a global scale backend with zero lines of code.</p> <p>As experts, I’d love to hear your feedback as we look to add new features and functionality to App Center</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:30 Pizza, drinks &amp; chat<br/>19:00 Leeds Sharp introduction and industry news<br/>19:15 Kaizen Bits<br/>19:30 Design Pattern Recognition<br/>19:45 Break<br/>20:00 Main talk - Build global scale mobile apps with C#<br/>21:00 The Brewery Tap for drinks and chats</p> '

  description: "<p>Further details to follow but we can promise great food, talks and discussions as usual. Want to speak or need help to develop a topic? Would you like some feedback on an idea? Get in touch and we can help.</p> <p>6.00pm - 6.30pm: Networking and food</p> <p>6.30pm - 7.15pm: Talk: Cynicism Doesn’t Build Products (Gwen Diagram)</p> <p>7.15pm - 7.30pm: Break</p> <p>7.30pm - 8.15pm: Talk;</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Talk: Cynicism Doesn’t Build Products (Gwen Diagram):</p> <p>How many software products have you worked on that have been ruined by cynicism? Not just scepticism but downright cynicism. As a software tester, a large part of my role is to be a skeptic but sometimes this crosses over to cynicism. Identifying risks in code, architecture and products is helpful, dismissing ideas is not, especially as this behaviour can rapidly spread. What if the team becomes cynical? How can we break out of the cycle and actually start building software?</p> <p>It’s very common for a team to pick up a piece of software and look at what has been written and decide, it’s simply trash. People believe that it can be built better. That the tools that the seemingly legacy software was built in have been superseded and the product is no longer fit for purpose. Cynicism for what is deemed as legacy but optimism for the brave new world.</p> <p>Gwen will look at cynicism, scepticism, optimism and more as attitudes to building products, legacy and green field. She will identify some attitudes that help build, strong, long lasting products. If cynicism isn’t cool anymore, then what is?</p> <p>Gwen Diagram:</p> <p>Gwen Diagram is a technology professional from Leeds who specialises in testing. She is an avid automation evangelist with a focus on testing complemented by repeatable build processes with monitoring. She has had varied roles throughout her career including Scrum Master at a Start Up and DevOps kid at a large Financial Services organisation. She is the Lead Product Tester at Monzo, a challenger bank focusing on building a product with known quality, fast.</p> <p>As a strong believer in making the tech industry as open and punk as possible, she co-organises a twice yearly free day long testing conference called the Leeds Testing Atelier. She speaks regularly at local meet-up groups, Agile Yorkshire and Leeds DevOps, duels with creative types at events like the Tech Off, speaks internationally at conferences such as Nordic Testing Days in Tallinn and was the closing keynote at Agile on the Beach in Falmouth, UK in 2018.</p> <p>Outside of work, you will usually find her hanging around a Natural History Museum somewhere in the world marvelling at how incredibly excellent dinosaurs are, feeding pigeons or ducks or researching the latest thing she has decided she is obsessed with.</p> "
