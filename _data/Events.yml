     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?



    Guelph Transit buses arrive at the University of Guelph Bus Loop every hour and half hour.

    Let's Talk Science requests your permission to take photos for the use of promotion and fundraising for future events. We do not publish names of anyone in the photographs, but we may post them on our social media platforms. In addition, this is a public event so media such as local newspaper photographers and video crew may be on site, so we cannot guarantee that you or your child will not be photographed.

    If I make a donation now, can I get tickets early? 



    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?



    Costumes are not required. However, we offer free face painting and wand-making at the event, as well as a "photo booth" where your child can have their turn to dress up like a wizard. 



    Do we sign up for individual classes?



    This event runs mostly as a large "Station Rotation". Some events are scheduled, such as our "Magical Lecture Series", so please refer to your Marauder's Map on the day-of for details.

  description: "The Austin Forum on Technology & Society\nin partnership with Austin Public Library \npresents\nBlockchain: Bringing the Transformation Home\nwith Jeremy Drzal, Block512 and Karen Kilroy, Kilroy Blockchain \nTuesday, July 10, 2018\nAustin Central Library - Event Center\n710 W Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX 787015:45 p.m. – Doors Open6:15 p.m. – Presentation, Q&A7:30 p.m. – Networking \nWhat is blockchain? Why has it emerged as a potentially disruptive solution for so many applications? How will it transform business, government, and society? How can/will Austin support, accelerate, and even lead this transformation?\nBlockchain is a technology that promises utterly secure transactions of all types. It is widely known as the foundation for bitcoin and now for many other digital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, but this is just one important application. Blockchain is a distributed computing technology founded on principles of security, transparency, and permanence, and has potential to increase usability and immutability of all kinds of records and peer-to-peer transactions, from health records to property ownership to distributed IoT applications and prevention/detection of contaminated or counterfeited physical goods—and more. It can accomplish such things while preventing unauthorized usage, corruption of information, and theft of assets. \nBut, what exactly is it, and how does it provide simplicity, enable security, remove ‘middlemen,’ and ultimately promise a more transparent-but-secure, peer-to-peer method of transactions with permanent records? Come hear blockchain experts Jeremy Drzal and Karen Kilroy explain all this and more, and learn how Austin can be a leader in the blockchain revolution. \nWe welcome your participation! Please send us your questions, answers and prognostications in advance at info@austinforum.org.\nAdmission to the Austin Forum is always free.\nThe Austin Forum accepts donations of used cell phones and smart phones at all our events. All devices will have a factory reset and be set up as new by the team at Austin Pathways’ nationally-recognized “Unlocking the Connection” initiative, which will connect every public housing resident with a digital device, digital literacy training, and a free or very low-cost internet connection. Your donated phone can change lives and help close Austin's digital divide, thanks to Austin Pathways.\nThanks to Austin Public Library for their partnership. \n\n\n\nAnd a special thanks to all our sponsors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n "

    ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS FOUNDATION

    Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 17.5 million deaths each year. Cardiovascular disease may strike those in their prime years and, due to population aging, also afflict elderly people who are otherwise living healthy lives. Improvements in cardiovascular therapy have markedly reduced procedural risk, and thereby enabled the treatment of a broad range of patients, more than ever before in the history of medicine. Nonetheless, significant disparities in the delivery of cardiovascular care continue to exist, leading to large unmet clinical needs for many patients worldwide. Innovation in the delivery of cardiovascular care, as well as education of the public at-large, is essential for optimizing the management of these patients.


    The Cardiovascular Innovations Foundation is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    The mission of the Foundation is to address unmet needs in cardiovascular care through the study, design, and development of innovative health care solutions and education of health care providers and the larger public.

- name: 'SMCKC July Breakfast: Facebook Success with a Team of One'
  description: >-
    Every social media manager wishes they had a huge budget, a big team and endless number of hours in the day to work with, however, for most businesses, this is not the case. Most social media marketing teams consist of one person who only has a few hours each week to manage Facebook - and all other social media accounts for the business.

    At this Social Media Club of Kansas City breakfast, Travis Pflanz will discuss tips, tactics, and tools for small business success on Facebook. This session is part presentation and a lot of group discussion. Come ready to share your favorite Facebook tactics and share your experiences - good and bad.

    You'll learn:



    Basic Facebook strategies for posting on the business page



    Tools that small businesses can use to automate some of their social media tasks



    A general feeling that they're not alone in the feeling of being over-whelmed (through discussion), and a deepening of community with other SMCKC members



    About our speaker

    TeacherCon is a free multi-day experience for Canadian educators in the K-12 school system, as well as student teachers and teacher leaders who want to inspire kids to be builders – not just consumers - of technology through coding activities and challenges. TeacherCon will provide how-to guides, hands-on training, lesson-planning tools, mentor support and access to an educator community for sustainable support and collaboration.Takeaways from TeacherCon will include Teacher Guides, access to an online lesson-planning platform, community support for afterward.We’ve combined our experiences teaching thousands of youth across the country to code, our tips and tricks to get started, resources to familiarize yourself with code, plus lots of easy to follow and even easier to implement coding activities to empower and teach the future generation of technologists across Canada.Let's shape how technology education is introduced in schools across the country - together!Agenda:


    Introduction to the “why’s” of Coding

    Exemplars of Coding Projects and Lesson Plans

    UnPlugged Coding Activities (no computer required)

    Coding and Debugging in Scratch

    Why Teach Code?Technology is everywhere and it’s not going anywhere. Teaching kids to code is about more than just helping children understand the technology they are using and secure employment in the future. At a fundamental level it improves problem-solving and thinking skills.We think it’s important for youth to learn to code for a few reasons:


    Coding is a superpower. Learning to code let’s kids build -- not just consume the technology around them like video games, websites, robots and more.

    Coding helps kids develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that gives kids a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships or jobs - they are valuable skills that are in high demand.

    Coding helps kids understand the world around them better. If we teach biology and mathematics in order to understand the world around them, then knowing the basics of how computers communicate - and how to engage with them -should be a given.

    Coding can help change the world empower kids to use technology as a creative tool to build solutions for problems or challenges people face everyday.

    Coding is fun! We want kids to experience the satisfaction and thrill of building something of their very own.

- name: Log Analytics & Flow and Logic Apps with Steve Spencer
  description: '<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, Log Analytics and Flow and Logic Apps both being presented by Steve Spencer.</p> <p>*Introduction to Log Analytics*<br/>In a world where distributed systems are the norm and where we are building more and more things as micro-services we need a way to keep track of what is going on. We need a central place where we can collate all the information we need to diagnose any issues we have without needing to remote onto a service and look through the log files. Wouldn’t it be good if we could also write queries and create alerts so that we know when things are going wrong before our customers do? This is where Azure Log analytics comes in. This talk will introduce some of the capabilities of log analytics, show how you can query your logs and create alerts.</p> <p>*Easy integration with Flow and Logic Apps*<br/>Historically integrating different systems has been challenging and you have needed experts to help you build even the simplest integration. Microsoft has introduced its azure based offerings to help take some of the complexity out of integrating to allow you to build your own personal workflows. This talk will introduce both Flow and Logic apps, show you where to use each and how you can migrate from Flow to Logic Apps.</p> <p>*Steve Spencer*<br/>Steve is an experienced .NET Developer, Microsoft Azure MVP and a Senior Solution Architect at Liberis. Steve has spoken at previous DDD events covering Microsoft Azure, Gadgeteer, Service Bus and Azure Web jobs</p> <p>Steve has also appeared on channel9 also talking on Service Fabric - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby" class="linkified">https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDaysOnline/UK-TechDays-Online-September-2016/Service-Fabric-for-the-Microservices-Win-baby</a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.recneps.net/" class="linkified">http://blogs.recneps.net/</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer" class="linkified">http://www.twitter.com/@sdspencer</a></p> '

- name: 'HaintonDotNet Leeds: Typescript for the C# Dev'
  description: "<p>Believe it or not, there are still a large number of .NET developers these days, that are happy to stay in the server domain, writing code only in C#<br/>While that may be your thing (and I'm not going to stop you) .... you owe it to yourself to at least explore the world of front end code.</p> <p>The problem is, the front end is... well, JavaScript, and we all know how that's panning out for the millions of those that use it everyday.</p> <p>Fear not however.</p> <p>There is a way you can explore programming in the browser, and still maintain all this nice stuff your used to in C# code, things like Type safety, OOP programming and generics.</p> <p>That Way is called TYPESCRIPT</p> <p>In this presentation, I'll show you some of the things that Typescript gives you to ease the pain and keep you clear of the world of JavaScript code.</p> <p>You'll see some of the newer ES6/7 Constructs that Typescript now embraces, but, more importantly, you'll get to play in the browser, while still thinking and working in a very back-end programmer like way.</p> <p>I'll not be teaching you the Typescript Language, nor will I be showing you any majorly cool coding tricks, I'll simply just be showing you that coming out of the server room, doesn't have to be painful at all.</p> <p>About the speaker, Peter Shaw:</p> <p>I'm a typical original UK back bedroom developer heralding back to the early 1980's. I cut my first bit of code in late 1970 in Sinclair basic and I've never looked back since.</p> <p>I've presented multiple times at DDD-North and twice at DDD Scotland, and can often be found poking around in the various UK user groups presenting for them. I help run one of the most prominent global .NET orientated user groups on the internet called Lidnug which is based on the Linked-In groups platform.</p> <p>I'm a Pluralsight Author and I'm the Author of 8 books in the Syncfusion Succinctly series and currently am on writing a real in print book for Packt</p> <p>I've worked with Orange Mobile Communications, The Royal &amp; Commercial Banks of Qatar and many smaller companies and start-up's in the 30+years I've been involved in I.T</p> <p>These days I run my own I.T consultancy here in the North East of the UK called \"Digital Solutions Computer Software UK\", and I build and maintain general I.T solutions to solve any problem you may be looking to solve.</p> "
