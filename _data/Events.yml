    Speaker: Professor Tim Kelly, Department of Computer Science

    Merchant Adventurers' Science Discovery Lecture

    Self-driving cars, crew-less tankers, parcel delivery by drones, service robots for the elderly:  The robots are coming! In the near future an increasing number of autonomous systems will be placed in roles, and given functions, that were previously the domain of skilled humans.  With their introduction there are promised improvements in efficiency, quality of life, and even safety. But what happens when these systems fail? Will human lives be put at risk?  Key questions need to be addressed in order for us to place our trust in these machines: Can ‘safe’ behaviour truly be defined and understood? Can we encode and emulate the ethics of a human operator? How can the underlying technology fail? Who is legally responsible when things go wrong?  This lecture will introduce some of the ongoing research at the University of York that is addressing these important questions. 

    Speaker biography: Tim Kelly is Professor of High Integrity Systems within the Department of Computer Science at the University of York. He is best known for his work on system and software safety case development, particularly his work on refining and extending the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN). His research interests include safety case management, software safety analysis and justification, software architecture safety, and the dependability of “Systems of Systems”. He has supervised a number of research projects in these areas with funding and support from Airbus, BAE SYSTEMS, Data Systems and Solutions, DTI, EPSRC, ERA Technology, Ministry of Defence, QinetiQ, Rolls-Royce, and the European Commission. He has published over 150 papers on high integrity systems development and justification in international journals and conferences.

- name: Building a better computer
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Jim Austin, Department of Computer Science

    Computer Science Lectures

    Building computers is a complex task, relatively inefficient, resulting in power hungry systems that untrained individuals cannot alter without some risk to the computer and to themselves. There must be a better way to do this that would make lives easier for everyone.

    Jim Austin has been working on a new concept in computing for over 17 years. Inspired by his immense collection of computers (www.computermuseum.org.uk) he felt it was time to take a fresh look at how we physically build a computer system – this has involved him in a wide range of subjects including, Computer Architectures, Computer networking, 3D topology, chemistry, 3D printing, Manufacturing, Design, physics – a fascinating and challenging journey.

    The idea stems from the basic concept of removing everything from the computer apart from the chips that drive it. The solution started out with a small plastic ball containing the chip which communicates and is powered without wires – throw a pile of balls into bucket and you have your computer – A Ball Computer (ABC).

    The practical conclusion of the ABC idea resulted in the COOL Computer, which will be demonstrated and the story of the journey in reaching the practical solution presented.

    Speaker: Dr Avtar Matharu, Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence

    Hosted by UoY Sustainability and UoY Events

    One Planet Week

    For all the good that Chemistry brings us, it is still very much misconstrued as dirty, polluting and harmful.  This image is often referred to as ‘brown or red’ chemistry and is gradually changing for the better to a variety of shades of green, encompassing sustainability and circularity. 

    This talk will give examples of turning waste into resource, promoting cradle to cradle rather than cradle to grave thinking, and will highlight global opportunities and barriers to development of Circular Economies.

    Speaker: Professor Andy Hunt, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Department of Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lectures

    In this lecture, Professor Andy Hunt explains how creativity and innovation is at the very heart of engineering, contrary to many stereotypes. His own work has focussed on the use interactive audio as a scientific analysis tool. He demonstrates multiple examples that use sound to reveal hidden information and structures in systems as diverse as learning about and debugging computer programs, and giving patients real-time feedback on their muscle action in therapy, through to recent international discoveries made using such sonification. He also describes how engineers contribute to the creative arts, how this collaboration leads to a stimulating curriculum and highly adaptable students, including demonstrations of student work.

    Speaker biography: Andy Hunt is Deputy Head (Teaching) of the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York. He studied Electronic Engineering at York in the early 1980s, and stayed on to work on the pioneering interdisciplinary MA/MSc in Music Technology (joint with the Department of Music), becoming its combined Chair of the Board of Studies. His PhD was in user-interfacing for musical control, and this led to many years researching and developing computer musical instruments for people with disabilities. During this time he created novel methods of teaching programming using audio. This led to an international collaboration on Interactive Sonification, co-editing the key textbook in this area, and launching a conference series. In recent years he has become Professor (Teaching & Scholarship), and led the curriculum reviews and work on the York Pedagogy in the department.

- name: Workshop on Data-Driven Video Storytelling @ The University of York
  description: >-
    Perspective Media: Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement is an EPSRC funded research project exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society. In collaboration with our partners BBC R&D, The Open Data Institute, The Digital Catapult, City of York Council, BAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen and others, we aim to exploit the power of video storytelling for engagement and literacy with data, and the potential of data analytics to reveal new opportunities for storytelling.

    To kick-off the project, we are hosting a 1-day research workshop at the University of York. This workshop will bring together academics, stakeholders from the creative industries and experts in data engagement to explore the opportunities and challenges posed by data-driven video stories. We will begin by sharing and discussing our research vision and plans. The remainder of the day will then be dedicated to the hands-on, experimental development of ideas and concepts for Perspective Media content, and the interrogation of those ideas in terms of the aesthetic, practical and ethical challenges they reveal. The workshop is the first in a series of activities that will be held over the next 18 months, including hackathons and the collaborative production of experimental content. We hope that you can join us to explore the potential of this exciting new content form.

    We hope that you will be able to join us in York!

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Four: Planting and Writing workshop at the T2/Pollination Allotment '
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \nSign up to join us!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Four: Planting and Writing workshop at the T2/PollinationAllotment \nThis workshop will take place down at the @YSJTerra2 and @ysjpollinationproject1 allotment on Haxby Road, a short bus ride away. We will think about the theme of beginning in ‘the middle’, based on the concept advanced by Deleuze, and we will read extracts from post-apocalyptic science fiction and solar punk. We will plant in rows of wildflower seeds, and then we will individually take a lawn chair off to a corner of the allotment space in order to write or sketch a response to the two experiences. Later, back at YSJ in a warmer environment, we will spend an hour discussing our ideas and developing a plan for an article, poem, short story, visual art, or piece of work for a summer submission to Terra Two. This workshop will be delivered jointly by Liesl King and Abi Curtis.\n"

  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

Staff and students who are interested in working together to facilitate Terra Two workshops in local schools and community venues may find this of particular interest. All are invited to begin creative work which can be submitted to Terra Two: An Ark for Off-World Survival for the next submission deadline, which is the 1st of April. \n\n"

- name: agileYork - Managing change in the 21st century + Greenfield vs Legacy Projects
  description: "<p>Managing change in the 21st century</p> <p>Nearly two decades into the 21st century and with nearly as much time passed since the Agile manifesto was written, what have we learned about change? Which is better: \"top down\", with the challenge of overcoming resistance to change, or \"bottom up\", perhaps never gathering momentum? Is it indeed a dichotomy, or can we find a third way for organizational transformation that is simultaneously respectful, ambitious, and sustainable? We'll explore a synthesis of ideas and techniques old and new, identifying along the way some widely-held beliefs that are now well past their sell-by date.</p> <p>Mike will be joining us the evening before delivering his Advanced Agendashift course (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/2AEH9B4</a>) which tradition dictates is always launched first in Leeds. If you are interested in attending then Mike has offered members of agileYork a 15% discount, just enter SHARE15 when booking.</p> <p>About Mike Burrows</p> <p>Mike Burrows describes himself as a champion and enabler of outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation. He is the founder of Agendashift, author of two books – Kanban from the Inside (Blue Hole Press, 2014) and Agendashift (Leanpub, 2017) – and the originator of tools such as Featureban and 15-minute FOTO. Prior to his consulting career, Mike was a CTO for a late-stage startup and global Executive Director for a top-tier investment bank.</p> <p>Trials and Tribulations of Greenfield vs Legacy Projects</p> <p>I've spent a large chunk of my career working on greenfield projects, the promised land. All of the projects faced different issues, and we worked towards coming up with different solutions. The promised land wasn't all it's cracked up to be. Recently, I've spent a lot of time working on legacy projects, bringing them into the modern world. Again, these projects aren't perfect and presented a whole variety of different issues. Let's explore the types of projects, and decide which is better: Greenfield, or Legacy.</p> <p>Joe Stead</p> <p>The majority of my career has been dominated by the .NET world, although recently my focus has been on exploring the greater development community. I'm a firm believer in continually learning and trying new things, you never know what else is out there. Recently, I've focused on setting up a user group and developer community in Hull, HullDevs<br/>Twitter: @Joe_Stead<br/>Website: joestead.codes</p> "

  description: '<p>Cake (C# Make) Build / #FAIL - Lessons from infosec incidents</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park will be teaching us how we can build anywhere by using cake build and Robin Minto will be walking us through challenges securing a web application.</p> <p>A Piece of Cake - C# powered cross platform build automation</p> <p>Have you ever wanted to create a build script for your application, but been faced with learning a new language, or DSL, or writing more XML than any person should ever need to? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others? Have you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?</p> <p>If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then the Cake ( <a href="http://cakebuild.net/" class="linkified">http://cakebuild.net/</a> ) Build Automation System is for you!In this session we will start with a standard .Net Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, using the C# skills that you may already have.</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park (@gep13 (<a href="https://twitter.com/gep13" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/gep13</a>))</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park has been developing on the .Net Platform for almost 10 years. His day job sees him developing using ASP.NET, AngularJS, and WPF, for Oil Companies working in the North Sea.</p> <p>In his spare time, Gary contributes to a number of Open Source projects including Chocolatey, Boxstarter, Cake, psake and GitVersion.</p> <p>Gary is a founding member of the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group, that holds monthly sessions on any topic related to the Microsoft .Net Technology Stack.</p> <p>#FAIL - Lessons from infosec incidents</p> <p>Securing a web application is a challenge. The internet is awash with malicious traffic and web applications are globally accessible. Don’t make it easy for them and the baddies will move on and find someone else to annoy.<br/>We’ll look at the risks facing web applications, the basic steps you can take so that you don’t make yourself a target and the things you should do to avoid becoming a data breach statistic. We’ll also look at lessons that can be learnt from mistakes that others have made.<br/>We’ll demo some of the techniques and tools in both attack and defence with examples for any web application developer.</p> '

- name: York Code Dojo February Meetup - Code Review
  description: "<p>For this York Code Dojo I'm planning on a doing a session based around some code reviewing. The idea is that I put up a piece of code on the screen and then you go away and discuss it (or re-write it) in pairs. After 5-10minutes we re-group and discuss it as a whole. We then move onto the next piece of code. I hoping to have a number of examples showing bad practice, bad algorithms, bad security, bad performance etc.. If anyone has any code they would like to contribute then that would be great. They can be a single method, class or program. Any mainstream language will be fine. This session will be suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers. If possible please bring a laptop with your programming language of choice already installed.</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided. On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor. Simply go into the library and either take the lift of walk up the stairs to the second floor.</p> <p>Sponsored by York St John University School of Art, Design and Computer Science.</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/6/e/600_458139022.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Steered and supported by YorkDevelopers (www.YorkDevelopers.org)</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/event_465122532.jpeg\" /></p> "
