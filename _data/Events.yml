Our presenters will demonstrate multiple software and their links to Revit, which include: Revit Live, Lumion and Enscape. They will provide live, \"fake\" (not real projects) models to demonstrate the real world, practical applications for visualization within Revit and Beyond!\nCome explore these different software options and obtain a better understanding of the different types, as well as the benefits of 3D visualization. Incorporating these software options into your daily workflow will help you achieve real time updates, exportable walkthroughs, easy software maneuvering, and basic graphic controls; not to mention the compatibility with Oculus rift technology. \nMake sure to reserve your seat now by registering.

  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p>Over half way through the year and we've had a load of fantastic speakers so far and we'll be bringing you more as the year goes on. This month we've got 2 great talks and we'll be giving away a ticket to the <a href=\"https://www.dotjs.io/\">dotJS</a> conference!</p> <p>First up we have Chad Gowler (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitation\">@kitation</a>) who will be giving a talk titled \"Mental Health in the Tech Industry\". Mental health is a hugely important yet ignored thing in our industry so I'm excited to have Chad talk for us!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Chad:</p> <p><i>\"Mental health is something that will affect most of us. The tech industry is high-paced and high pressure, and this means that we may be leaving some developers to struggle. This talk will examine touchpoints such as meetings, code review and timesheets and think about ways that they could cause difficulty. We will think about how we can make them easier to navigate so that developers can get back doing to what they do best.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we have Martin Nyaga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Martin_Nyaga\">@Martin_Nyaga</a>) with a talk titled \"State Machines in Javascript: What, Why &amp; How\". I'm not from a computer science background so initially I thought the talk may be too heavy for those like me, but after chatting to Martin it sounds like a great talk for everyone!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Martin:</p> <p><i>\"Finite State Machines are a large area of focus in theoretical computer science, but are rather underutilised outside of CS101. Without going deep into mind-numbing computational theory, this talk explores a bit about what they are and how they can be practically useful in day to day web-development, using a real life Javascript example. I’ll also explore some of the javascript tooling available. This talk is suitable for people with CS and non-CS backgrounds alike.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
