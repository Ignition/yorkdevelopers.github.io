  description: "<p>Join us for a celebration of agileYork's 1st birthday! (There will be cake ;)</p> <p>12 months have passed and we've discovered so much along the way. Join us to learn just how a meetup called agileYork was formed using Agile! A number of past attendees have asked how they could start a meetup group and this evening will describe just that.</p> <p>From a very simple idea you'll discover how we as a group tested assumptions, experimented with formats and collectively built a meetup through feedback.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6pm: welcome &amp; arrivals<br/>6:30pm: welcome &amp; arrival<br/>6:45 pm: eat, drink, chat &amp; celebrate<br/>7.00pm: Creating an Agile meetup using Agile<br/>8.00pm: Change the Language, Change the Rules<br/>9:00pm: to the bar/pub?</p> <p>Change the Language, Change the Rules</p> <p>The language we use influences the way we see the world, how we work<br/>together and what we believe is possible. Want to find out how the<br/>structure of language, neuroscience and a bit of pseudoscience can<br/>help build a high-performing agile team? Then drop by for a case study<br/>on how to use Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) in agile teams, with<br/>real world examples, hints, tips and tricks.</p> <p>About Tom Hoyland</p> <p>With a career spanning software engineering, business analysis and<br/>digital transformation, Tom coaches a wide range of teams, weaving<br/>together agile values, language and psychological safety to build high<br/>performing, sustainable teams.</p> <p>A host at Agile Sheffield and a regular speaker at<br/>agile and product meetups, Tom enjoys presenting case studies,<br/>research and insights into successful agile transformations, team<br/>working and their metrics.</p> <p>Oh did I mention there will be cake ;)</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group! You can earn SEUs by attending our events. ***</p> "

We'll see how PHP fits into this front end ecosystem and how to augment our applications with real time components.</p> <p>✩ From bare metal boxes to Amazon ECS, our journey to the cloud<br/>Mark Taylor</p> <p>My talk will tell the story of how DealTrak moved from over a decade of bare metal hosting to AWS with practically zero downtime, and the technologies we opted for.

- name: 'All Our Futures: An education fit for the world of the mid-21st century'
  description: >
    What is education really about if not building the future?


    In modern times, the pace of change has quickened with every passing generation and shows no sign of slowing down. What sort of education does this generation of young people need to help it meet the demands, opportunities and challenges of that future? 


    Guided by the provocative thoughts of real experts in the fields of AI, biotechnology, the environment, the economy, lifespan & the future of work, and societal values/morality, delegates will work together to draw up A Manifesto for an Education for All Our Futures which will be shared with policy makers and opinion formers around the country. 


    The speakers are:


    Rohit Talwar CEO Fast Future Research: international speaker and consultant; joint author of Future Reinvented – Reimagining Life, Society, and Business and Beyond Genuine Stupidity – Ensuring AI Serves Humanity


    Kresse Wesling Environmental entrepreneur and campaigner: founder of Elvis & Kresse, which turns industrial waste into innovative lifestyle products and returns 50% of profits to charities and organisations related to the waste


    Nick Gowing Journalist and presenter with BBC News 24, ITN and Channel 4 News; extensive reporting experience in diplomacy, defence and international security; currently Visiting Professor in the School of Social Science and Public Policy at Kings College, London


    Jules Evans Policy Director of Centre for the History of the Emotions, Queen Mary University, London; author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations and The Art of Losing Control


    Mike Shaw is a full-time geek, teaching non-stop at Bootham School since the 80s.  He is passionately interested in the future because that’s where he intends to spend the rest of his life.  His only regret is that he was born too late to meet Isaac Newton and too soon to visit Mars


    Hosted by:


    Chris Jeffery Headmaster of Bootham School and Bristol Rovers fan
