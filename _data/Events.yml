- name: 'Professor Anil Seth: What in the World is Consciousness?'
  description: >-
    Consciousness is, for each of us, the presence of a world. Without consciousness there is no world, no self: there is nothing at all. But we know surprisingly little about the material and biological basis of this most central feature of our lives. How do rich multisensory experiences, the senses of self and body, and volition, agency, and ‘will’ emerge from the joint activity of billions of neurons locked inside a bony skull? Once the province of philosophy and theology, understanding consciousness has emerged as a one of the great scientific challenges for this century. In this talk, Professor Seth will sketch the state-of-the-art in the new science of consciousness, with a focus on what neuroscience has to offer. He will distinguish between conscious level (how conscious we are), conscious content (what we are conscious of), and conscious self (the ‘I’ behind the eyes), describing in each case how new experiments are shedding light on the underlying neural mechanisms, in normal life and in neurological and psychiatric conditions. Throughout, Professor Seth will emphasize phenomenology – the way things seem – as the target for any satisfying explanation of how the brain, in conjunction with the body and the environment, gives rise to and shapes conscious experience.

- name: 'A Fortunate Universe: Life in a Finely Tuned Cosmos'
  description: >-
    Over the last forty years, scientists have uncovered evidence that if the Universe had been forged with even slightly different properties, life as we know it - and life as we can imagine it - would be impossible. Join us on a journey through how we understand the Universe, from its most basic particles and forces, to planets, stars and galaxies, and back through cosmic history to the birth of the cosmos, to the conclusion that we truly live in a fortunate universe.

    "Geraint and Luke take you on a tour of the Cosmos in all of its glory, and all of its mystery. You will see that humanity appears to be part of a remarkable set of circumstances involving a special time around a special planet, which orbits a special star, all within a specially constructed Universe. It is these set of conditions that have allowed humans to ponder our place in space and time. I have no idea why we are here, but I do know the Universe is beautiful.  A Fortunate Universe captures the mysterious beauty of the Cosmos in a way that all can share.”Brian Schmidt, Nobel Laureate in Physics

    Speaker: Professor Atsufumi Hirohata, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Department of Electronic Engineering open lecture

    Technology has been reducing in physical size for 50+ years and this has driven the incredible increase, power and sophistication in almost everything we use, from mobile phones to potable computers to future autonomous cars. However, this continued drive to shrink electronic components is reaching its limit, reaching to six individual atoms and new and exciting technologies much be found to help us continue with our never-ending appetite for more functionality. 

    In this lecture Professor Hirohata will give an introduction to the issues we currently face and the new technology of spintronics. He will go on to show how this could be the technology of the future and how it might replace current devices. Finally he will talk about issues that still need to be solved, why our research might not be solving these issues and where he sees the future of spintronics in 10-20 years. 

    The event is preceded by a drinks reception in PT005A from 5pm, all ticket holders are welcome to attend. 

    Speaker biography: Dr Atsufumi Hirohata joined the Department of Electronics in September 2007. He has over 15 years of experience in spintronics, ranging from magnetic-domain imaging to spin-current interference. He is currently an editorial board member of Journal of Physics D and Spin. He is also a member of both Administrative and Techical Committees of the IEEE Magnetics Society. He holds a visiting associate professorship at Tohoku University and a Royal Society Industry Fellowship in collaboration with Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory.

  description: "ARCC network \nShowcasing research to deliver impact\n15 &16 November 2017 (residential)\n\nAs the head of the new UKRI, Sir Mark Walport’s initial public statements have articulated that success will be measured through the impact it delivers.  For you as researchers, you will increasingly be called upon to deliver your results to non-academic audiences, and this is more than the papers you publish in journals.  Join us at this workshop to discuss what impact really is, and how you can achieve it across the duration of your research. \nThe workshop will be structured around facilitated sessions, focussing on various approaches to showcasing research outputs to reach a variety of audiences, and practical challenges to allow participants to build on their own expertise and put the concepts into practice. Creative approaches using exhibitions, trade fairs, videos and blogs, and public media channels will all be discussed as options for delivering imapct.\nWe hope participants will gain a better understanding of the benefits and challenges of different approaches to communicating outputs that will be of assistance in their own research activities. The transferable skills gained during this workshop will help participants enhance the value of their work, its use and potential impact. \nTarget audience: early career researchers working on adaptation in the built environment and infrastructure sectors.\nWorkshop facilitators: Dr Pete Walton, KE Fellow University of Oxford, Tanya Wilkins, Communications specialist, ARCC Network, UKCIP, and invited experts\n\nThere is no charge for this event. All meals, refreshments and overnight accommodation at the venue on 15 November are provided. Numbers are limited to 20.  "

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

The trail starts at 2.30 or 3pm on July 6th.\n\n\n===\nFor details of special event in June 2017, please see  yorksciencetrail.eventbrite.com\nThis link, for the regular monthly meetings, is yorksciencetrails.eventbrite.com\n                                 \n\n===================\n                                    MORE  DETAILS  FOLLOWING  SOON!\n\n====   SEE BELOW FOR TEXT RELATING TO OUR FIRST MEETING ON 5 DECEMBER:\nThis is an OPEN meeting to discuss a proposed Science Trail for York. Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

  description: "<p>It's Ada Lovelace Day coming up on October 10th. This is an international celebration day of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). It aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and, in doing so, create new role models who will encourage more girls into STEM careers and support women already working in STEM. (<a href=\"https://findingada.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://findingada.com/</a>)</p> <p>Ada is known as the mother of computing, considered to be the first computer programmer before computers even really existed. She wrote a paper in the 1840s imagining the potential of Babbage’s machines, including the idea that they could compose music and the original computer algorithm is now widely considered to be the world’s first computer programme.</p> <p>She went on to inspire early computer pioneers including a certain Alan Turing (who found her paper during his research). Turing is of course the mathematician whose codebreaking Enigma computer helped end the Second World War.</p> <p>We're proud to celebrate ALD at Sky@LeedsDock and have arranged for a <b>free private screening</b> of the excellent film ‘<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/\">Hidden Figures’</a> at the swanky <b>Everyman Cinema in Leeds City Centre.</b><br/>The film tells the true story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson – 3 brilliant African-American women working at NASA who served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that turned around the Space Race. The visionary trio crossed all gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big.</p> <p>Complimentary Pizza and Prosecco will also be served.</p> <p>We have limited tickets available so please only RSVP if you are 100% able to attend<br/>Look forward to seeing you there!</p> "

- name: agileYork - The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership
  description: "<p><b>The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership</b></p> <p>\n\nWhile business knowledge and domain expertise is useful and essential, is this only achievable with a 'single wringable neck'? What would happen if the whole team could be encouraged to take ownership of product direction?</p> <p>This session looks at how we have often created dysfunctional relationships with our product owners through both the way we collaborate (or don't) with them and the language we use to talk about the role itself.</p> <p>We will discuss questions like:</p> <p>is having a product owner an anti-pattern?why do we discourage 'hero' developers but encourage 'hero' product owners?do product owners make it hard to have a sustainable pace?can the whole team engage in product ownership?what can you do to support your PO?</p> <p><b>About John Le Drew</b></p> <p><br/>Starting my career in systems administration, I first dipped into software engineering writing automation and data migration tools mostly using Perl and VBScript on Windows. This sparked my interest and led to 10 years as a software engineer, working in a wide range of environments and languages including C, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, VB, Java, JavaScript and probably more that I have forgotten!</p> <p>After a decade as a software engineer, I then spent most of the last 10 years as an independent consultant. Working with companies to help them get the most out of their technology teams. I soon recognised that the technological problems I was hired to solve, were rooted not in technology, but in the way teams were collaborating. This led me to research lean and agile ways of working, transforming my practice.</p> "

- name: Recent excavations at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr
  description: "<strong>Professor Nicky Milner, Deputy Head of Department, Department of Archaeology, University of York<br />\n</strong><br />\nStar Carr is an internationally important Mesolithic site that dates back to roughly 9000 BC. First discovered and excavated in the 1940s it unearthed some extremely rare and intriguing objects, such as headdresses made from red deer skulls and amber beads, which had been preserved in the peat for millennia. The rarity of such objects made the site famous in the archaeological world and many different interpretations were made as to what sort of site it was: e.g. base camp, hunting camp, tanning site, or kill site. From 2004-2015 further excavations took place led by a team from the Universities of York, Manchester and Chester. Although severe deterioration of the deposits had taken place, other rare discoveries were made including more headdresses and an engraved pendant. In addition, three large wooden platforms were uncovered representing the oldest evidence of carpentry in Europe. These important findings have changed the ways in which we understand how hunter-gatherers lived, shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. "
