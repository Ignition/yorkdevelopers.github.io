- name: The Clean Architecture by Ian Cooper
  description: "<p>Ian Cooper - The Clean Architecture</p> <p>What is 'the clean architecture' and how would you build one in .NET?</p> <p>Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures, including hexagonal architecture, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that, in the bulk of the presentation, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET.</p> <p>From first steps to working code, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core</p> <p>Twitter: @icooper</p> "

Well, in this session you’re going to find out! We’ll be looking into query performance and that means reading query plans, but in order to do that we also need some background knowledge of how the query optimiser works. With that in mind we’ll be jumping right into optimisation stages, hints and rules. We’ll also learn how to keep track and influence how the engine optimises our queries, and we’ll see if it’s a good idea or not.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>David Alcock is a Developer turned DBA turned Data Professional and is the Principal Consultant for DTA IT Consultancy, a company he started to help people build and grow their data platforms</p> '

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
