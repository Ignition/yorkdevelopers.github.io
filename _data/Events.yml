    The 2018 K-12 STEM Symposium

    It takes a community of teachers, mentors, parents and local leaders to nurture a child’s curiosity of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Linking science and mathematics taught in the classroom to impactful careers is an ongoing national challenge. This year’s Symposium will help children discover new and exciting possibilities in the STEM fields within the National Capital Region. Elementary, middle and high school students will learn about computer coding, space, 3D printing, drones, connected cars and healthcare through a wide range of fun and interactive exhibitors and speakers.

    High school and college internship opportunities can help students better understand exciting and wide-ranging careers available to those with STEM degrees. Summer and school-year STEM enrichment programs are a large part of a child’s interest in becoming proficient in the mathematics and sciences. Simple tools such as educational science and technology apps, family-friendly physics experiments and robotics building can also influence a child’s proficiently in the math and science.

    Special Thank You to our Presenting Sponsor Altamira Technologies 



     

    Quick Facts:



    This is the fifth year running since the initial STEM Symposium in 2014. We have only grown in size and diversity of age ranges, gender and race

    We project over 3,500 parents, kids and teachers to be in attendance

    Over 50 exhibitors from the business, government, academia and nonprofit sectors will be represented

    Exhibits include 3D printers, drones, flights simulators, physics experiences, heart monitors, topography models, puzzles and many robotics teams

    Over 20 local students will present top science fair projects before regional competition



    Mission and Outcome:

    The largest K-12 STEM Symposium in Northern Virginia, the Symposium provides the opportunity for students, parents and teachers in the National Capital Region (NCR) to interact with key business, education, non-profit and government leaders through real-life applications and presentations about how science, technology, engineering and mathematics impacts our community.

    Parents will be directed to a variety of K-12 STEM opportunities that exist in the National Capital Region.  From academic competitions, internships, after-school activities, special events, science and math enrichment courses, science fairs and more – parents remain in the driver seat of their child’s education.

    Industry leaders also have the opportunity to gauge the proficiency of the local STEM pipeline.

    Bottom Line:

    The opportunities for students who are STEM-proficient are endless. Connecting exciting career opportunities to math and science taught in the classroom is critical for encouraging and keeping children interested in pursuing STEM careers. Get informed. Get excited. Get started.

    The World's Largest DevOps Event,June 5 - 7, 2018at the Javits Center in New York, NY!

    The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.

    The @DevOpsSummit at Cloud Expo - to be held June 5-7, 2018, at the Javits Center in New York, NY - will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of enterprise IT professionals put out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.

    Join @DevOpsSummit Chair June 5-7 for three days of intense DevOps discussion and focus.

  description: >+
    Tickets go on sale March 1st, 2018 at 1:59 PM EST

     

    What is Stir Trek: 2018 Edition?

    Stir Trek: 2018 Edition is our tenth iteration for the Stir Trek conference. As before we're stirring web, mobile, client, and cloud development topics together along with quality, security, soft skills, design, and user experience content to present a fun day of learning. There will be eight tracks of sessions, breakfast, lunch, and a private screening of Avengers: Infinity War, which opens in theaters the day of the event - May 4th, 2018.



    What Topics Are Being Covered?

    The Stir Trek website lists the current Schedule, Sessions and Speakers that we have confirmed.



    What Does It Cost?

    In order to cover the significant costs of a large scale event like this one, there will be a $125 fee for attendance. This will be the best $125 you spend this year, however. Take a look at what you get.



    What Do I Get?

    It is our goal to bring you significantly greater value than your $125, and here’s how we intend to do it:


    Registration materials mailed ahead of event

    48 sessions of critical content

    Well-known regional and national speakers

    Lunch and Breakfast

    Attendee T-shirt

    Private screening of Avengers: Infinity War at the end of the day

    Refreshments during the movie



    How Many Tickets Can I Order at Once?

    Like previous years, you can order up to 20 tickets in one order.  If you need more than 20 tickets for your team, you will need to place multiple orders.  Please make sure that you include the appropriate name, address, and t-shirt size for each person you're buying a ticket for.  There's nothing more disappointing than receiving an awesome box from a conference and getting a shirt two sizes too small.



    How do I know what size t-shirt to order?

    We have creating sizing charts for our shirts to help you get a feel for which size will fit you best.  We offer both m

    en's and women's styles, so make sure you pick the cut that you prefer.




     Can I Buy Another Movie Ticket?

    Like our previous events we will be offering a limited sale of additional movie passes at a later date.  Registered conference attendees will be notified when additional movie passes are available for purchase.  Once these additional passes are sold out we can not offer any more.

- name: 'Data Science in 30 Minutes: Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning with Spark Creator and Stanford Professor, Matei Zaharia'
  description: >-
    Join The Data Incubator and Databricks co-founder, Matei Zaharia, Ph.D for the next installment of our free online webinar series, Data Science in 30 minutes: Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning.

    Abstract:  Despite incredible recent advances in machine learning, building machine learning applications remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for all but the best-trained, best-funded engineering teams. This expense usually comes not from a need for new and improved statistical models but instead from a lack of systems and tools for supporting end-to-end machine learning application development, from data preparation and labeling to productionization and monitoring. In the Stanford DAWN project, we are developing a set of tools to make these processes easier, from weak supervision approaches to dramatically reduce the need for labeled data, to query-specific model specialization to reduce serving cost, and end-to-end ML systems that encapsulate a complete task and greatly simplify the interface to the user.

- name: 'Trottier Symposium: Planning for Resiliency in the Face of Climate Change'
  description: "\nThe 5th annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy and Design\n\nPLANNING FOR RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nEngineering and design for sustainability are an essential part of a multi-faceted response to climate change particularly in urban centres, which may include increasing our resiliency in the face of extreme weather events, changing our water management practices, or adapting our cities and infrastructure to an unpredictable future. There is a need to identify robust strategies for responding to the challenges brought by climate change through adaptation, reorganization, and evolution. Our response to climate change must include solutions that allow our socio-ecological systems to not only survive, but thrive.\nThe 2018 5th Annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy, and Design will focus on resilience and human responses to the threats brought on by climate change, while considering the following questions:\n\nWhat is resilience and why is it so important to ensure sustainability in the context of urbanization and climate change?\nHow can we be more resilient to disruptions such as extreme weather events, floods, drought, sea level rise, and heat waves? What solutions are being imagined, developed, and implemented?\nHow can infrastructure be protected and self-renewed following extreme weather events or other stresses exacerbated by climate change?\n\n\nSpeakers\nThe symposium is a free, public event, featuring prominent speakers on each day of the 2 day event. \nApril 4th - Day 1 - 6pm to 8pm\nGuy Nordenson, Professor of Structural Engineering and Architecture, Princeton University School of Architecture\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nPippa Brashear, Director of Planning and Resilience, SCAPE\n\nDESIGNING FOR RESILIENCE: ECOLOGY + ENGINEERING + ENGAGEMENT\n\nTranslating the ideas of resilience into realizable actions and implementable designs can be challenging. We are forced to design with uncertain and incomplete information for an environment that is changing around us. However, the need for action and innovation is urgent, and success requires collaborative and interdisciplinary action. This presentation explores the process that has taken one innovative coastal resilience project from conceptual idea to the later stages of design and the lessons learned about integrating and implementing physical, ecological, and social resilience on the way.\n\n\n\nAlan De Sousa, Borough Mayor of Saint-Laurent and City of Montreal Councillor\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nApril 5th - Day 2 - 6pm to 8pm\nKaren Seto, Professor of Geography and Urbanization Science, Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\nHOTTER, WETTER, DRIER: GLOBAL TRENDS IN URBANIZATION AND CHALLENGES FOR RESILIENCE\nThis talk will focus on global trends in urbanization and exposure to climate change impacts. It will highlight extreme climate events around the world - bomb cyclones, wildfires, floods, droughts - and how future urbanization may increase risk and vulnerability to these hazards.\n\nPhilippe Gourbesville, Professor Hydroinformatics and Water Engineering, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis\nRESILIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CITIES\nDuring the last decade, urban development has reached new submits with generation of mega cities that concentrates several millions of inhabitants. Those new urban environments represent unknown challenges for modern societies that are still using – implicitly or explicitly – the same concepts for urban development since millennia. Sustainability of urban centres is today a major priority that has to be approached in a holistic way. The size of cities requests to rethink and review some of the engineering concepts that are currently used and to shift from the centralized approach to the distributed and connected paradigm. At the same time, gradual sophistication of urban environment has generated a significant increase of global vulnerability regarding extreme weather events that are frequently affecting urban communities. \n\nMore Information: http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables\n\nVers une Stratégie de Résilience Face aux Changements Climatiques \n En matière de développement durable, l’ingénierie et la conception sont des éléments essentiels à une réponse multidimensionnelle au changement climatique, particulièrement dans les centres urbains. Il pourrait s’avérer nécessaire d’augmenter notre résilience dans le contexte des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, de changer nos pratiques de gestion des ressources en eau ou d’adapter nos villes et nos infrastructures pour faire face à un avenir imprévisible. Nous devons donc définir de solides stratégies pour répondre aux défis entraînés par les changements climatiques, grâce à l’adaptation, à la réorganisation et à l’évolution. Notre réponse aux changements climatiques doit comprendre des solutions qui permettront non seulement à nos systèmes socio-écologiques de survivre, mais également de prospérer.\nLe 5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables, édition 2018, porte principalement sur la résilience et les réponses humaines aux menaces qui découlent des changements climatiques, tout en se penchant sur les questions suivantes :\n\nQu’est-ce que la résilience et pourquoi est-il si important d’assurer la durabilité dans le contexte de l’urbanisation et des changements climatiques?\nComment pouvons-nous faire preuve d’une plus grande résilience aux perturbations comme les phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, les inondations, les périodes de sécheresse, l’élévation du niveau de la mer et les vagues de chaleur? Quelles solutions sommes-nous en train de concevoir, d’élaborer et de mettre en œuvre?\nComment pouvons-nous protéger les infrastructures et comment celles-ci peuvent-elles s’autorenouveler sous le coup des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes ou des autres stress aggravés par le changement climatique?\n\n\n\nConférenciers\n\nÉvénement public gratuit, le symposium présente des conférenciers de renom durant les deux jours du symposium. Les présentations seront données en anglais. \n  \n\n4 avril – 1re journée – de 18 h à 20 h\n\nGuy Nordenson, professeur, ingénierie structurale et architecture, école d’architecture de l’Université Princeton\nPippa Brashear, directrice de la planification et de la résilience, SCAPE\nAlan de Sousa, Maire d’arrondissement Saint-Laurent et conseiller de la ville ensemble Montréal\n \n\n5 avril – 2e journée - de 18 h à 20 h\n\nKaren Seto, professeure, géographie et études en urbanisme, école de foresterie et d’études environnementales de l’Université Yale \nPhilippe Gourbesville, professeur, hydro-informatique et ingénierie de l’eau, Université Nice-Sophia-Antipolis\n \nPour en savoir plus : http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n"

- name: Undoing the Future, a lecture by Karen Barad
  description: 'The indeterminacy of time-being at the core of quantum theory troubles the scalar distinction between the world of subatomic particles and that of social phenomena such as colonialism, capitalism, militarism, racism, nationalism and environmental destruction – all of which are entangled with nuclear and particle physics research. Quantum physics is a material-discursive practice with direct ties to the military-industrial complex, and while it gave birth to the atomic age, quantum physics disrupts classical Newtonian physics (which has its own troubled legacy in the service of war, colonialism, capitalist expansion, and empire building), including its foundational notions of space, time, and matter. In the annual Roslyn Silver ’27 Science Lecture, Karen Barad takes up quantum physics’ immanent deconstructive dynamics, consider ways in which quantum physics troubles modernist conceptions of time, and ask whether quantum temporalities might offer radical political imaginaries for cohabiting this planet more justly by undoing the future.Karen Barad is Professor of Feminist Studies, Philosophy, and History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, she co-directs the Science & Justice Graduate Training Program, funded by the National Science Foundation, which “trains science and engineering students alongside social science and humanities students to identify and respond to moments where research requires attentiveness to questions of policy, ethics, and justice.” She has a doctorate in theoretical partical physics and is the author of author of Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning.Details and AccessibilityThis event is free and open to the public. The venue is accessible to people with mobility disabilities. Please contact BCRW for additional accessibility needs.'

- name: James Briscione Evening Lecture
  description: >-
    THE TALK: The Flavor Matrix

    A groundbreaking ingredient-pairing guide, The Flavor Matrix shows how science can unlock unheard-of possibilities for combining foods into astonishingly inventive dishes. Briscione distills chemical analyses of different ingredients into easy-to-use infographics, and presents mind-blowing recipes that he’s created with them. The result of intensive research and incredible creativity in the kitchen, The Flavor Matrix is a powerful tool for home cooks and professional chefs alike. Join James as reveals the trials, failures and successes that led him to creating The Flavor Matrix. 

    James Briscione is the first two-time champion of Food Network’s Chopped, a regular host and judge on Food Network, the Director of Culinary Research at the institute of Culinary Education (ICE), celebrity chef and one of People Magazine’s ‘Sexiest Chefs Alive 2016.’ He is the author of four books: Just Married & Cooking (Scribner ’11), Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson (Sourcebooks ’15), The Great Cook (Oxmoor House ’15) and The Flavor Matrix (HMH ’18). As an instructor at one of the world’s top culinary schools, James Briscione thought he knew how to mix and match ingredients. Then he met IBM Watson while developing ICE’s Modernist Cuisine. From 2012-2014, he worked with IBM and the “Chef Watson” team to help understand how flavor compounds and ingredients translate from a database to the real-world kitchen. Working with the supercomputer to turn big data into delicious recipes, Briscione realized that he (like most chefs) knew next to nothing about why different foods taste good together. That epiphany launched him on a quest to understand the molecular basis of flavor—and it led, in time, to The Flavor Matrix. The food and ideas that James created with IBM have been featured in the New York Times, The New Yorker, NBC, BBC, NPR, Time and hundreds of outlets around the globe.

  description: "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Join us for our First Leeds Apache Kafka meetup on March 14th from 6:00pm hosted by Sky Betting and Gaming in Leeds. The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:00pm: Doors open<br/>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Networking, Pizza and Drinks<br/>6:30pm - 7:15pm: Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL, Robin Moffatt - Confluent<br/>7:15pm - 8:00pm: Full Stream Ahead!, Ashley Broadley - Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>8:00 pm - 8:15pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----<br/>Title:<br/>Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again!</p> <p>Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. These data pipelines can be built using configuration alone.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll see how easy it is to stream data from a database such as Oracle into Kafka using the Kafka Connect API. In addition, we’ll use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and then stream this from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of code!</p> <p>Why should Java geeks have all the fun?</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Robin Moffatt, Confluent</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Robin is a Partner Technology Evangelist at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. He blogs at <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff. Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time.</p> <p>-----<br/>Title:<br/>Full Stream Ahead!</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>How the Promotions Tribelet at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming plan to go faster, why it's important to keep reassessing your previous choices and why Kafka is integral to our future plans. A little story about what we've learnt and what it takes to affect change.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ashley Broadley</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Ash is a Principal Engineer at Sky Betting &amp; Gaming. Starting off as a standard LAMP Engineer, introduced to Real-Time data processing in 2016, his world changed as he was blown away by the capabilities that Kafka offers. Leading the technical side of the Promotions API &amp; Messaging API services, aiming to build Real-Time data models based on Apache Kafka.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>The full address for the venue is:</p> <p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>3rd Floor<br/>6 Wellington Place<br/>Leeds<br/>LS1 4AP</p> <p>For people who have visited the Sky Betting &amp; Gaming offices previously, this is our new building.</p> <p>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and general car parking. There is a designated quiet space by request in advance. This isn’t a hearing loop, or a bsl interpreter. There is a level route from the NCP car park (which has limited accessible parking spaces), CitiPark, and the train station.

But there are other coding horrors that should trigger alarm bells whenever we see them, whether in a legacy codebase or when doing code reviews. Like a good horror movie, coding horrors should scare us when we find them, because they’re often symptomatic of deeper problems. So let’s take a short tour of some of the greatest horror movies ever made (and a few turkeys); and some of the most worrying code horrors that I’ve seen."</p> <p>Mark is ZCE; Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak; Coordinator of Open Source PHPOffice library suite (PHPExcel, PHPPowerPoint, PHPWord, &amp;c); Trainee cat herder.</p> <p>✩ A journey into API performance and security using PHP Silex<br/>Blair Garrett <a href="https://twitter.com/blairguk" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/blairguk</a></p> <p>"I’ll take you through the practices, tools and techniques I employed when making my best attempt to secure and speed up API’s. For this talk I’ll be using the PHP Silex framework. I’ll go through the reasons for my choice of tools which you can lean on. These will ensure your API goes like the clappers and the bad guys can’t get in. This is loosely based on a read world example.
