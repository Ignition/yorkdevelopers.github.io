  description: "<p>As part our Leeds Blockchain Meetup's push to work closer with the local community we are joint hosting an event with the Leeds University Business School and the students’ Blockchain Society (LUUCABS).</p> <p>We are lucky to have a guest speaker from Vancouver who is a leader in the Ethereum field and is originally a local Leeds lad and alumni of the University.</p> <p>Bob Summerwill is a Blockchain Lead at Quantfury, Co-Founder and CTO of Varro Technologies, a community leader for the Ethereum Project and Community Ambassador for CryptoChicks. Originally from the UK, he has lived in Vancouver since 2003, and is now a dual citizen of Canada and the UK.</p> <p>He was foundational in the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), working full-time on that project for ConsenSys from October 2016 to October 2017. He co-presented the Technical Roadmap at the EEA launch event and served first as Secretary of the Technical Working Group and subsequently as Vice-Chair of the Technical Steering Committee.</p> <p>That role followed a spell at the Ethereum Foundation, where he was a developer on the cpp-ethereum client, leading a major refactoring and revamp of the codebase (cpp-ethereum-1.3.0 \"Homecoming\") and led a failed effort at re-licensing cpp-ethereum which was intended to open up the possibility of an Ethereum client within Hyperledger seven months before Monax made that a reality.</p> <p>Bob will be giving a 1 hour talk as the headline speaker plus we will also be announcing our next blockchain hackathon following on from the successful one in November.</p> <p>After the talks there will be opportunity to network and ask further questions on campus.</p> <p>Address:<br/>Leeds University Business School<br/>Maurice Keyworth Building<br/>Moorland Road<br/>LS6 1AN, Leeds, UK</p> <p>Room: G02 (lecture hall next to the reception)<br/>Time: 18:00 – 20:00 + networking</p> <p>The Leeds University Union Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Society (LUUCABS) has as its objective to ensure that people can access as much knowledge as possible surrounding the topics of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This comprises organisation of events such as trading and investing tutorials, blockchain coding lectures and hackathons. If you are experienced or even just curious in this rapidly growing technology – please be sure to follow on Facebook so that you can stay up to date with the events!</p> "
