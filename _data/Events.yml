- name: agileYork - The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership
  description: "<p>The 5 pillars of collaborative product ownership</p> <p>While business knowledge and domain expertise is useful and essential, is this only achievable with a 'single wringable neck'? What would happen if the whole team could be encouraged to take ownership of product direction?</p> <p>This session looks at how we have often created dysfunctional relationships with our product owners through both the way we collaborate (or don't) with them and the language we use to talk about the role itself.</p> <p>We will discuss questions like:</p> <p>is having a product owner an anti-pattern?why do we discourage 'hero' developers but encourage 'hero' product owners?do product owners make it hard to have a sustainable pace?can the whole team engage in product ownership?what can you do to support your PO?</p> <p>About John Le Drew</p> <p>Starting my career in systems administration, I first dipped into software engineering writing automation and data migration tools mostly using Perl and VBScript on Windows. This sparked my interest and led to 10 years as a software engineer, working in a wide range of environments and languages including C, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, VB, Java, JavaScript and probably more that I have forgotten!</p> <p>After a decade as a software engineer, I then spent most of the last 10 years as an independent consultant. Working with companies to help them get the most out of their technology teams. I soon recognised that the technological problems I was hired to solve, were rooted not in technology, but in the way teams were collaborating. This led me to research lean and agile ways of working, transforming my practice.</p> "

  description: "<p><b>Matthew Skelton: Continuous Delivery - making it work with Windows and .NET </b></p> <p><br/>The technologies and approaches for Continuous Delivery are essentially identical across different operating systems, but some things need special treatment for Windows and .NET. When Jez Humble and Dave Farley published their groundbreaking book 'Continuous Delivery' in 2010, many of the tools described were either nonexistent on the Windows platform or did not support the rich automation capabilities they do now.<br/>This talk aims to encourage many more teams working with Windows and .NET to adopt Continuous Delivery by sharing real-world success stories of organisations using Windows and .NET for Continuous Delivery; the speakers share their first-hand experience in different organisations and also explore some case studies from the O'Reilly eBook '<a href=\"http://cdwithwindows.net/\">Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET</a>'.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nBiog: Matthew Skelton has been building, deploying, and operating commercial software systems since 1998.

- name: Recent excavations at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr
  description: "<strong>Professor Nicky Milner, Deputy Head of Department, Department of Archaeology, University of York<br />\n</strong><br />\nStar Carr is an internationally important Mesolithic site that dates back to roughly 9000 BC. First discovered and excavated in the 1940s it unearthed some extremely rare and intriguing objects, such as headdresses made from red deer skulls and amber beads, which had been preserved in the peat for millennia. The rarity of such objects made the site famous in the archaeological world and many different interpretations were made as to what sort of site it was: e.g. base camp, hunting camp, tanning site, or kill site. From 2004-2015 further excavations took place led by a team from the Universities of York, Manchester and Chester. Although severe deterioration of the deposits had taken place, other rare discoveries were made including more headdresses and an engraved pendant. In addition, three large wooden platforms were uncovered representing the oldest evidence of carpentry in Europe. These important findings have changed the ways in which we understand how hunter-gatherers lived, shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. "
