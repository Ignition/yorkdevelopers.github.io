- name: 'Alex Bellos: The World’s Favourite Number'
  description: >-
    Maths writer Alex Bellos was so sick of being asked for his favourite number that he started to ask everyone else the same question. More than 40,000 responses later he had a treasure trove of data. In a talk that includes mathematics, psychology and the history of science, Bellos reveals the curious patterns behind our emotional responses to numbers - what they say about us, and what’s important about them.

    Speaker: Professor Damian Murphy, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    The creative industries in the UK make up a significant part of our economy and can be rightly considered a global success. Working together across the arts, science and engineering is fundamentally important for our creative sector to maintain this position. New immersive and interactive creative technologies bring emerging challenges and opportunities for both our content creators, and the engineers and technologists behind the systems used to author this content, as audiences adapt and change to how they demand and consume their digital media.

    The audio industry has, for many years, successfully brought together the arts, science and engineering, established through a common language, appreciation and understanding of music, and its creation, capture, storage, manipulation and delivery across many different forms. Professor Damian Murphy will explore research that has emerged from the Department of Electronic Engineering AudioLab, as part of more than thirty years of the University of York’s contribution to the shape and definition of this multi-disciplinary field. From the creation of virtual sound environments to the impact of sound on our environment; through listening to the past to telling stories in new ways for next generation audiences – what might our future sound like?

    There will be a drinks reception in the Treehouse from 5.30pm to 6.30pm for ticket holders. 

    Professor Damian Murphy

    Damian Murphy is Professor in Sound and Music Computing at the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York, where he has been a member of academic staff since 2000, and is the University Research Theme Champion for Creativity. He started his career in the Performing Arts Department at Harrogate College and has previously held positions at Leeds Metropolitan University and Bretton Hall College. His research focuses on virtual acoustics and he has published over 130 journal articles, conference papers and books in the area. He is a member of the Audio Engineering Society, a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and a visiting lecturer to the Department of Speech, Music and Hearing at KTH, Stockholm.

    Speakers: Susan Halfpenny and Stephanie Jesper, Information Services

    Information Services Lecture

    Once upon a time, there was a world before our own: a land where the internet didn’t exist. It was a magical place... of playing outdoors, looking up information in books, visiting the library! An age when you didn’t know everybody’s bad opinions on every topic; where meeting people actually involved going to a physical place! That fabled land is a fading memory. Now it’s hard to go a day without using digital technologies.

    In this new and confusing world, we can barely tell fact from fairytale. Trolls no-longer simply hide under bridges, while big bad wolves keep their big big eyes on us, recording our every action. Has something got lost in this digital forest? Have we traded the prospect of a happy ending for a handful of magic beans?

    In our digital age the ability to effectively use, manipulate and produce digital content is fast becoming a requirement for participation in social, economic and political activities. It is therefore essential to develop the skills for this engagement: to become “digital citizens”.

    In this lecture we explore opportunities and challenges presented by digital services and technologies: how have our perceptions of public and private changed? What is the impact on our security and freedom? Does technology present a threat to our democracy or open us to a global community of information-sharing and collaboration? Join us as we travel the utopian and dystopian landscapes of the digital world in search of the answer to how we might all become empowered digital citizens.

- name: Clean Air Day- air pollution and York
  description: "Air pollution, its all over the news and all over our cities, but what do you really want to know about it?  Come along to find out about air quality research at the University of York, how it relates to this beautiful city and where it impacts on our everyday lives. Take the opportunity to quiz experts from the University and York City Council on all things air pollution, and consider the simple things that can be done to help improve the air we breathe.\nHosted by the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York, this event aims to raise awareness of air pollution issues - particularly in York - ahead of Clean Air Day (20th June), the UK’s largest air pollution campaign.\nAbout the speakers\nDr David Carslaw is a Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York. His research is focussed on developing a better understanding of urban air pollution, particularly around emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Much of his work is aimed at better quantifying vehicle emissions under urban driving conditions. Another area of focus is the development of receptor modelling approaches to improve understanding of the influence of different emission sources on ambient concentrations. \nAlastair Lewis is Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York working within the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories. He is also currently Deputy Director of, and Director for atmospheric composition, at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). He has participated in over 30 major atmospheric science field projects, from polar regions to tropical oceans, city centres to remote forests. He is a member of a number of expert advisory groups including for Defra, the World Meteorological Organisation and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nLiz Bates is a University of York alumni employed as a specialist air quality officer at City of York Council and City of Bradford MDC. She helped develop the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) and Low Emission Strategy (LES) for York and has a specialist interest in low emission planning. She helps to co-ordinate Clean Air Day activities in York.\nHealth in Urban Environments Event Series\nThe event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.\nThrough a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.\nBy bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.\nThe series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York."

- name: 'Sustainability Metrics: Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II'
  description: >-
    Aim of the workshop

    Measure and monitor your supply chain’s performance with appropriate and easy-to-use sustainability metrics. Existing industrial sustainability metrics primarily focus on the chemical process, although the need to consider the performance of a “bigger picture” is prevalent and growing. This workshop is dedicated to demonstrating current trends and practices in applying qualitative and quantitative sustainability evaluation practices, through use of LCA and other industrial best procedures.

    Context There is a current need for innovative business models that are sustainable and resource efficient to meet with fast-approaching and stricter environmental targets. Reducing, neutralising or going negative with carbon emissions in any process is a challenge, regardless of the sector. Creating a circular economy could be the ideal solution to overcome this challenge. Undertaking these responsibilities to the highest accuracy, extensiveness of this reporting and transparency among stakeholders are currently some of the major hurdles. Some enterprises have, however, been successful. With a view to creating a dialogue and awareness of the various methods of tracking and reporting these sustainability characteristics, in portfolio management, systems thinking to end of life management strategies, the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence is organising a “Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II” event.

  description: "<p>Greetings agileYorkers! This being our first event with our new host Hiscox is likely to be a highly interactive evening.</p> <p>Ball Runner</p> <p>In this game teams are challenged to achieve a series of simple tasks as quickly as possible. The game will quickly introduce bottlenecks, which in turn will generate a high amount of work in progress.</p> <p>Teams are given the opportunity to make several attempts, each time taking the opportunity to inspect and adapt. It covers the key agile principles of continuous improvement, self organising teams, challenging process, while touching on ideas from theory of constraints and kanban.</p> <p>About the games creator</p> <p>Lloyd Jones (@l0p3zj0n3s) originally created Ball Runner at the #play14 unconference in London in September 2015. He was toying with the idea of a game around work in progress (WIP), which can be incredibly stressful for teams, and for individuals on these teams. He imagined a team playing a game in which one individual was bombarded with balls while trying to do something with them.</p> <p>At the unconference, a small group broke out to explore this idea. The result covered much more than his original intentions, but he believes the result is more useful.</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

I will then follow up with a demonstration of a project using Gatsby along with a Headless CMS solution called Sanity. I will showcase how this fits into the JAMstack and why it is proving to be a success.</p> <p>Sam Beckham (@samdbeckham) - Making GitLab a PWA<br/>This is not your typical PWA talk. We're not going to make a dummy application that's perfectly tailored for use with a PWA, then show you just how easy it is to turn it into one. We're not going to talk about how much faster, or how much more useful our website is now that it's a PWA. We're not even going to make anything particularly useful.</p> <p>I'm going to show you how to use the concept of \"the boring solution\" to make small changes to a big application. Small changes that, over time, turn in to large ones.

- name: ACCU York [Apr 2019] - Quickly testing legacy code
  description: "<p>This month we welcome Clare Macrae to ACCU York.</p> <p>Talk Detail:<br/>You've inherited some legacy code: it's valuable, but it doesn't have tests, and it wasn't designed to be testable, so you need to start refactoring! But you can't refactor safely until the code has tests, and you can't add tests without refactoring. How can you ever break out of this painful loop?</p> <p>Clare will present a powerful approach to solve exactly this problem, in both legacy and green-field systems: Llewellyn Falco's \"Approval Tests\". In addition to its existing implementations for Python, .NET, Java, NodeJS, Swift and others, there is now a C++ version.</p> <p>She will describe the use of Approval Tests in some real-world situations, including how to quickly lock down the behaviour of legacy code. She will show how to rapidly achieve good test coverage, even for very large sets of inputs. Finally, she will also describe some general techniques I learned along the way.</p> <p>About Clare Macrae:<br/>Clare has worked in technology for over 30 years, and is a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. When not thinking about supporting teams to streamline development and releases, she spends time with family and friends, and more recently, also contributes C++ code to the CycleStreets journey planner.</p> <p>----<br/>Thank you York Science Park for providing us a place to meet<br/>Supported by YorkDevelopers<br/>ACCU York is an ACCU local group</p> "

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
