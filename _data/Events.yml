- name: Is Free Will an Illusion?
  description: >-
    While many believe that free will is vital for human dignity, morality and responsibility, others claim it is an illusion. But what exactly is free will? Do we have the kind of free will which gives us enough control over our own lives for our choices to make a difference? What about notions of blame and responsibility? Join philosopher Julian Baggini and psychologists Christian Jarrett and Adrian Raine to find out more.

- name: A Guide to the Unknown Universe
  description: >2+


     



    You’ve probably heard of a little thing called the universe. And you probably know about physics, the stuff that explains how the universe works...

    but what you might not know is just how much we actually don’t know !!

    We are so pleased to welcome the most entertaining experts at explaining (un)known things, here, at York: PhD Comics’ Dr Jorge Cham and physicist Prof Daniel Whiteson !!

    In their new book, "We Have No Idea," Jorge and Dan explore why a vast portion of our universe is still a mystery, and what a lot of smart people are doing to understand it. And to mark the release of their hilarious and helpful guide to the Unknown Universe, we want to have this quirky, vibrant and engaging discussion by a cartoonist and a physicist, here, at York.



    This fun event is really perfect for anyone who’s curious about all the great mysteries physicists dream to solve next !!

    While many talks explain what we know about the universe, this one tackles all the weird stuff we haven’t figured out yet. Let's explore some of the biggest holes in our cosmic knowledge:



    why does the universe have a speed limit?

    what (or who) is attacking earth with tiny, super-fast particles?

    what exactly is Dark Matter?

    and for that matter…what is matter?



    This interactive and extremely entertaining lecture will along the way demystify complicated things such as quarks, neutrinos, gravitational waves and exploding black holes -- enjoy !!



    "A delightful combination of comedy and cosmology that is as charming as it is informative," Zach Weinersmith (creator of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)



    Btw, our visitors will be signing books after the fun lecture, which will be available for purchase that day. Of course, if you don’t want to wait, you can already get the book at all major retailers.



    All about the most entertaining researchers on this planet:



    Jorge is the creator of "PhD Comics", the hugely popular ongoing internet and print comic strip about life (or the lack thereof) in Academia. He is also the co-founder of PHDtv, a video science and discovery outreach collaborative, and a founding board member of Endeavor College Prep, a non-profit school for kids in East L.A. He earned his Ph.D. in Robotics from Stanford University and was an Instructor and Research Associate at Caltech from 2003-2005.

    Daniel graduated with a PhD in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003 and is now a Fellow of the American Physical Society and Professor of Experimental Particle Physics at the Dept. of Physics & Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. He conducts research as part of the ATLAS collaboration based in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and his research has received significant recognition in popular media outlets such as The New Yorker and VICE.

- name: The Voices in All Our Heads
  description: >-
    Psychologist and award-winning writer, Charles Fernyhough tells a story of things in our minds. He explores the inner voice and dialogue in all our heads, and how this may help us understand how and why some people hear voices.

    Charles’ talk is a story of the things that we think. As you read this, you might recognise an internal voice that talks you though what is written. It’s quite normal and it doesn’t upset you. It might also be there when you remind yourself what you need to do, and what you think about things.

    Many psychologists think that those who hear voices have lost the ability to connect themselves with this voice so they think it doesn’t belong to them. This can become distressing.

    In order to understand voice hearing, we therefore need to understand more deeply how we talk to ourselves – our internal dialogue - in terms of why we do it and how it works.

    Charles will review some of the recent findings on voice hearing and inner speech and explore the implications of these. He will discuss this in relation to the contrast between how common this inner speech is, but how hearing voices is seen as atypical. He will also talk about why it can be valuable to understand some forms of voice hearing as inner speech, as well as how this interacts with memory.

    About the speaker

    Dr Charles Fernyhough is a psychologist and award-winning writer. He is Chair in Psychology at Durham University, having gained a first degree in Natural Sciences, followed by a PhD in Developmental Psychology from Queens’ College, Cambridge. Charles is a Chartered Psychologist and Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society.

    In addition to numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals, Charles has also written a selection of fiction and popular non-fiction books. His awards include a Time to Write Award from the Northern Writers’ Awards and an Arts Council of England Grant for the Arts.

    He has taught creative writing, with a particular focus on psychological processes in reading and writing, in a variety of contexts around the UK, including a short course on Creative Writing and Psychology at Newcastle University.

- name: Astrocampus Star Party - Late Night Observing
  description: >-
    As we move further into spring, the nights are becoming shorter and shorter. As a result, there's less opportunities available for astronomy. So wrap up warm and join us at the University of York's Astrocampus on 26th May as we stay up late to learn all about the night sky and (weather permitting) explore it in great deal with our telescopes!

    The main intention of this event will be to make good use of the observatories and telescopes that we have available here at the University of York. The night before will be a new moon, meaning the skies will be as dark as possible for us to hopefully observe some deep sky objects. This would include star clusters, nebulae and other galaxies! If the skies are clear, then there's plenty for us to look up at in the fast approaching summer sky. At the very least though, the planet Jupiter will be shining brightly in the sky, and when peered at through a telescope it'd be hard to miss its four Galilean moons!

    However, clear skies unfortunately aren't a guarantee. So over the course of the event, there will be a range of different talks delivered as well. Topics include:



    Looking at the basics of astronomy, and learning how you can best get involved with the hobby yourself at home



    The history of telescopes, telling the 400 year long story from Galileo's handy refracting telescope, to the James Webb Space Telescope being launched by NASA next year



    A lesson in cosmology, looking at the hidden parts of our universe that we simply cannot see or detect yet makes up most of the universe




    Hot drinks will be provided!

- name: Safety Vs Security?  ISTR 25th Anniversary AGM and Summer Symposium 2017
  description: "\n4-5 July 2017 - University of York\nSafety Vs Security - complementary or competing needs?\n2017 marks twenty five years of ISTR -  25 years driving and supporting the safety agenda in the technology and research sector. In this, our Silver Anniversary year, ISTR is delighted to invite members and friends to the historic city of York to celebrate this significant milestone in our development. Our AGM and Summer Symposium at the University of York is the perfect opportunity to catch up with old friends, make new ones and hear some outstanding speakers discuss a range of  issues facing safety and security professionals and building designers and managers in delivering on both the safety and security agendas. \nOur theme Safety Vs Security - complementary or competing needs? will explore the potential tension between the two. How do we ensure ease of egress in an emergency, while maintaining building security? How do we secure designated hazardous substances while ensuring prompt and easy access for emergency services needing to effect staff rescue? Our symposium speakers will discuss travel safety and security in the face of an increasing turbulence internationally. In addition, with public engagement high on the agenda of universities and research institutes, the challenge of facilitating safe public access while keeping a flagship research building secure will be explored. \nWe will focus on how to balance safety and security needs when designing new buildings and ensuring designers correctly understand the nuanced brief. The challenge of implementing systems for monitoring out of hours workers will be discussed and our ever popular Discussion Forum (where we have an opportunity to learn from and share with each other) will round off a busy programme. It promises to be a topical, informative and practical day!\nOn the previous evening (July 4th), our AGM and Anniversary Dinner will take place in the 16th Century King's Manor.

  description: "                   York  Science  Trails:   a new project\n\n                             Diversifying  York's  history \nvia Science, Technology, Engineering,  Medicine and  Mathematics.\n\n                        Will you or your group(s) get involved ?\n\nOpen Meetings: 2nd Monday of each month\n12 noon; King’s Manor Refectory\n                             email  JOHN BIBBY    jb43@york.ac.uk\n\n===\nFor details of special event in June 2017, please see  yorksciencetrail.eventbrite.com\nThis link, for the regular monthly meetings, is yorksciencetrails.eventbrite.com\n                                 \n\n===================\n                                    MORE  DETAILS  FOLLOWING  SOON!\n\n====   SEE BELOW FOR TEXT RELATING TO OUR FIRST MEETING ON 5 DECEMBER:\nThis is an OPEN meeting to discuss a proposed Science Trail for York. Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

Testing is one of those areas that people often skip or forget about and it's great to have Colin join us to talk about it and it's importance</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Colin:</p> <p><i>\"Testing is important - it can improve the quality of your code and give you the reassurance to refactor without fear of destroying your application.</i></p> <p><i>My talk will cover different types of automated testing  in javascript (unit, integration, acceptance) and some regression as well tools to help standardise code (like js lint).</i></p> <p><i>I'll also talk about automated build tools like jenkins and travis ci.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we've got Lorna Mitchell (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lornajane\">@lornajane</a>) with a talk titled \"Fun with serverless Javascript\". Serverless is one of the areas of development which is growing and I'm really looking forward to hearing more about it!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Lorna:</p> <p><i>\"Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for JavaScripters of all levels.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk.

  description: "<p><b>What's happening?</b></p> <p>Are you an artist, maker, hobbyist, tinkerer, engineer or someone who just likes to make things or even just discuss creativity in Leeds?</p> <p>Come along and talk to like minded people and members at Leeds Hackspace, feel free to bring along a project that you're working on or just have a chat.</p> <p><b>So is this free? Do I have to book or something?</b></p> <p>Yes, it is free. Leeds Hackspace is a work-space, community group type and workshop area. We have snacks you can buy at our own Tuck Shop, internet access via WiFi or wired Ethernet.</p> <p><b>There doesn't seem to be many attending?</b></p> <p>A lot of our members, some 30+ do not use Meetup, and they regularly attend the open evenings/days without RSVPing on here. So don't worry, the open evenings happen regularly and every week.</p> <p><b>What do you have?</b></p> <p>Wood and metal workshop, laser cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl cutter, computers, electronics, a heat press, and all sorts of <a href=\"https://wiki.leedshackspace.org.uk/wiki/Leeds_Hackspace\">other goodies</a>. However, using a lot of these things require an induction and for you to be a paying member, but we have these open evenings so that you can look around and check the place out. Some members are happy to help you if you need to be pointed in the right direction or have something that needs repairs.</p> <p><b>So is this a business.. ?</b></p> <p>Leeds Hackspace is registered as a business, but it is run voluntarily by Directors and members, if you want to see a change you can make it happen.</p> <p><b>How do I get there?</b></p> <p>You can find out more details about visiting here: <a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\"><a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/</a></a> there is limited on-site free parking, and on-street parking is free after 6pm.</p> <p><b>What if I want to ask more questions?</b></p> <p>We also have a mailing list: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space</a></p> "
