    Speaker: Professor Jim Al-Khalili, University of Surrey

    Jim Matthew Lecture

    Like many physicists in the UK of my generation, Jim Matthews was a huge inspiration to me, both as a teacher and researcher as well as a communicator of physics. It is therefore a great honour for me to be delivering the Jim Matthews Lecture in the year that he sadly passed away. Science communication has of course changed out of all recognition over the past couple of decades that I have been actively involved in it. In this lecture I will chart my own personal journey in becoming a ‘public scientist’ while never wishing to sideline my academic career in teaching and research – indeed, following very much in Jim Matthews’ footsteps. I will also discuss how and why science communication in the UK has undergone such a revolution, to the extent that we now lead the world by a decade or more in the public engagement in science, from communicating and debating the vitally important ways in which science is needed to address the challenges of the 21st century to the outright fascinating discoveries still being made about the workings of our universe. 

    Professor Jim Al-Khalili

    Jim Al-Khalili OBE FRS is a theoretical physicist, author and broadcaster based at the University of Surrey where he holds a joint chair in physics and the public engagement in science. He received his PhD in nuclear reaction theory in 1989 from Surrey and, after holding several prestigious research fellowships, was promoted to professor in 2005. He has written twelve books, translated into over twenty languages – including, later this year, his first novel. He is a regular presenter of TV science documentaries and presents the long-running weekly BBC Radio 4 programme, The Life Scientific.  He is a recipient of the Royal Society Michael Faraday medal, the Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and the inaugural Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication. He was awarded an OBE for services to science in 2007 and made a fellow of the Royal Society in 2018. He is the current president of the British Science Association.

    Speaker: Dr Annie Hodgson, Department of Chemistry

    Department of Chemistry Open Lecture

    Some of the most amazing scientific discoveries have been made completely by accident. The sign of a great scientist is that they recognise the significance of what they observe; then led by curiosity and imagination experiment to develop an idea or invention. Whether the accident is the result of a clumsy cat or a careless chemist, serendipity has played an important role in the history of science. Dr Annie Hodgson will take you into the world of serendipitous discoveries and will try to recreate some of these accidents on purpose!

- name: 'Professor Joseph Silk: Dark Matters'
  description: >-
    The York Union warmly invites you to attend our second external speaker event of 2019 as we welcome Professor Joseph Silk for an address titled:

    'Dark Matters.' 

    The emergence of cosmic structure is an outcome of the Big Bang that we study by peering back through the mists of time with giant telescopes to extract knowledge about the most remote objects in the Universe. One of the greatest mysteries in the cosmos is that it is extremely dark. Not only is the night sky mostly dark, but also most of the matter  in the universe is dark. For every atom visible in planets, stars and galaxies today there is about six times more matter in some invisible form. The Universe not only contains dark matter but its mass budget is dominated by even more mysterious dark energy. This is acts like antigravity, and has accelerated the rate of cosmic expansion in the recent past. Professor Silk will describe the dark side of the Universe, how we measure it, and why it matters.

    Professor Silk is an astrophysicist and a leading expert on the early Universe. He is a Balzan Prize winner and one of the world’s most sought-after science communicators. He is a research scientist at the Service d’Astrophysique, CEA, Saclay and the Institut d’Astrophysique, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris,  Homewood Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and Senior Fellow in the Beecroft Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford. 

    Professor Silk is also the Gresham Professor of Astronomy and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He is one of the world’s leading researchers into theoretical cosmology, dark matter, galaxy formation and cosmic microwave background. Having delivered some of the most important invited astronomy lectures around the globe and with over 500 publications to his name, he is one of the world’s foremost science communicators. His books include: The Big Bang, Horizons of Cosmology, The Infinite Cosmos, On the Shores of the Unknown, A Short History of the Universe and Cosmic Enigmas.

    The address will include a Q&A during which time audience members can pose questions to Professor Silk. Our events are as intelligent as our audience so please join us for what should be a lively and engaging evening!

    Please bring your free ticket with you to the event. You cannot be guaranteed entry without your ticket and those without tickets may be allowed entry only if spaces are available.

    To cover the expenses of hosting this event we suggest a small donation of £2 from students and £4 from members of the public at the door for those who are able. The York Union is a strictly not-for-profit organisation run by a small group of volunteers.

- name: 'From scarcity to abundance: How water resource management can contribute to cooperation and stability in the Middle East'
  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Clive Lipchin, Arava Institute, Israel

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    The Middle East is one of the world’s most water scarce regions, but also has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. That means water demand is fast outstripping supply and climate change impacts will only exacerbate the issue. Despite this dire reality, Israel today has a water surplus, and has successfully decoupled itself from the vagaries of diminishing freshwater supplies.

    In this presentation Dr Lipchin will discuss how Israel went from a water scarce to a water abundant country. He will discuss the implementation of successful technologies, the government policies and economics that encourage the adoption of a water smart country, and a culture that encourages and supports innovation and conservation. He will also discuss how Israel can leverage its water abundance for regional cooperation and stability.

  description: >-
    Speaker: Dr Nic Carslaw, Department of Environment and Geography

    Department of Environment and Geography Lecture Series

    In developed countries, we have been estimated to spend about 90% of our time indoors, for instance at home, at work, or commuting between the two. It therefore follows that our exposure to air pollution, whether to pollutants generated indoors or outdoors, happens mainly in the indoor environment. This presentation will introduce the audience to the many ways in which we can be exposed to air pollution indoors, including through activities such as cooking or cleaning. The presentation will finish with some methods for reducing our exposure to pollution indoors as well as some to avoid, along with some thoughts on future issues for indoor air quality.

- name: Towards Sustainable Plastics
  description: >
    A free symposium on the challenges and solutions to the global issue of plastic waste pollution

    Over recent years, there has been significant attention drawn towards the environmental damage caused by traditional plastics. This global pollution issue has arisen from several factors including complications surrounding the direct reuse of consumer packaging, challenges associated with chemical recycling and subsequent separation of plastic additives, the chemical composition of commonly used plastics, together with many socio-economic and infrastructure issues. Due to diversity of these key problems, a multitiered approach, utilising different expertise is needed to challenge the problem of plastic waste holistically.

    Why attend?


    Build knowledge and bridge the different technical areas (from polymer design to additives extraction and recycling)

    Forge new relationships in the field of sustainable plastics in our networking sessions

    Discuss potential sources for funding important research over the next few years, such as the forthcoming ISCF Wave 3

    Enjoy a free buffet lunch and wine reception following the event

    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of January 2019 confirmed speakers and workshops include pioneers from organisations such as Complexiti, NHS, QinetiQ, Illuminate Technologies, YHROCU and the National Spectrum Centre. Areas to be explored include gene therapy, scientific policy making, future applications of technology (5G, for instance) and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

    Notably, we're excited to be partnered with Supporting Women in Science (SWIS) and will be hosting a riveting and relevant panel discussion 'Women in Stem - Challenges & Opportunities', designed to break through to the key points of view and move the conversation forwards. 

    To conclude the event, we will be hosting a networking drinks evening to which all delegates will be welcomed warmly, to discuss key insights from the day, forge long-lasting connections and enjoy good company. 



    FAQ:



    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. As there will be a drinks evening with alcohol, we will be expecting guests who are fortunate enough to look under 21 to provide proof-of-age where requested.

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Facebook: facebook.com/YorkScienceConference --> Feel free to message us, we respond rapidly!

    LinkedIn: York Science Conference --> This is our more corporate platform, we're happy to receive questions/thoughts through this medium though.

- name: IDGC-YCCSA Seminar:Information Transforming Human Network Systems to a Sustainable Nexus Multiplex
  description: >-
    The Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre and York Cross-Disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis are pleased to present a seminar by Dr. Roger Cremades from the Climate Service Centre, Germany.

    IGDC Research Seminar Series: Exploring sustainability, resilience, security and complexity within the water-energy-land-food nexus.

    Abstract:Separate considerations of water, energy, food and land use pressures and environmental constraints result in a waste of resources and incoherent planning worldwide. Current modelling of these pressures as an integrated nexus captures limited instances of a more complex feature: the distribution and trade networks formed by each of these nexus elements. Together these form a ‘multiplex’ that has not been studied previously as a whole. Moreover, the sustainability properties of these multiplexes and their implications for development are not understood. Using big data techniques to assimilate real-world water, energy, commodities’ trade and transport networks, and graph theory and complex systems science to analyse and model them, the seminar will explore how to (i) analyse their emerging complex properties, (ii) understand which of these properties lead to sustainability, (iii) test these properties and study their full potential in transformation simulation models to better understand and enhance sustainability, resilience and security, and (iv) formulate a new data-driven theoretical paradigm that studies sustainability from a systemic multiplex perspective. This project will lay the groundwork for new approaches to evaluating sustainability and development using the latest advances in big data and complex systems.  

    Freshements will be available after the talk followed by a discussion session.

We aim to cover Software Engineering, Data Science, Design and Agile topics over the course of 2019.</p> <p>Confirmed speakers for the event are:</p> <p>Jason Lord, Scrum Master – “The Need for Transformation”. Both the banking and IT industries continue to evolve and with Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) being firmly across both they are no exception. In this session Jason will discuss why LBG recognised the need to transform how they deliver IT projects. Talking as Scrum Master, Jason will give overview of DevOps technologies the bank are using and will then discuss what DevOps means culturally and how adapting Scrum methodology supports the cultural changes required.</p> <p>Richard Bishop, Engineering - “Transforming Testing for DevOps at Lloyds Banking Group” In the race to deliver software projects more efficiently whilst maintaining quality, Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) development and testing needed to change. LBG software development has transformed from traditional centralised teams serving multiple projects to smaller, business-aligned, multi-disciplinary teams managing development and testing. By introducing DevOps, Agile and Performance Engineering principles across the group and combining traditional enterprise tools with open source, LBG has increased automation and reduced handovers between teams, in doing so has reduced software development costs and timescales. In this session, LBG will give an insight into their DevOps journey from a testing perspective; describing lessons learned as well as some of the difficulties that they faced during their transition.</p> <p>Doors open at 5.30pm in the Event Space at the excellent Duke Studios, 3 Sheaf Street, Leeds LS10 1HD, just an 8 minute walk from Leeds Train Station. Entry is by strictly by Eventbrite ticket only, so please ensure you register above and bring a printed or electronic copy.</p> <p>This is an informal event for local technology practitioners.</p> <p>This event is brought to you by Lloyds Banking Group Engineering #horsepower</p> '
