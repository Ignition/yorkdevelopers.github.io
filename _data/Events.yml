    Research in Focus

    Microscopy is going through a revolution.  Modern computing power, cameras and laser technology have unlocked the ability to image microbial life at high speeds and in three dimensions, advancing our capacity to capture biologically-important events.  Using these tools, our groups have explored the microscopic world; discovering how disease-causing pathogens swim and ‘talk’ to each other, how microbes move in extreme environments, and how carnivorous plants lay insidious traps in the soil. We will talk about how we have used holographic microscopy to study Leishmania, the world's second deadliest parasite, and reveal details of it move through its lifecycle to attack new hosts.  We will explain how some of this work was achieved, what’s going on in our labs at the moment, and what we think the future holds for this cutting-edge technology.

    This event is followed by a drinks reception, exhibition and 3Sixty installation - all attendees welcome.

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites'
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

- name: LeedsDevops - April 2018 Meetup
  description: "<p>It's time for another devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 17th April. The evening will be:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Look Ma, no Code! Apache Kafka and KSQL<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Ansible Enterprise Grade<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>For those of you who squeezed into the ODI for our February meetup you will have heard from William Hill about their use of Kafka, we've invited Robin Moffat from Confluent to come and give us a deep dive in all things Kafka and streaming data.</p> <p>Robin is a Partner Technology Evangelist at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director and Developer Champion. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. He blogs at <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff.</p> <p>Robin's talk us \"Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL\" - Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. These data pipelines can be built using configuration alone. In this talk, we'll see how easy it is to stream data from a database such as MySQL into Kafka using the Kafka Connect API. In addition, we'll use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and then stream this from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of code!</p> <p>Our second talk of the evening is from Phil Cornelius who is an Ansible Specialist for EMEA. He joined Red Hat in 2016 from Credit Suisse where he was responsible for the developer tools and services for 3000 applications, developed by 8000 developers globally. Phil's background is primarily application development, specifically Enterprise Java. Phil brings over 18 years of experience in what is now commonly called DevOps.</p> <p>As you introduce Ansible into your organisation there are additional requirements to make running Ansible ‘Enterprise Grade’. This session is a live demo of some of key use cases for Ansible in the Enterprise. You will get to see Ansible Tower with a specific focus on Application Lifecycle Management.</p> <p>We are again delighted to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any LeedsDevops event are required to agree with the code of conduct.</p> <p>Venue</p> <p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street (not too far from the Adelphi).

This can lead to feelings of personal doubt (e.g. imposter syndrome) and mental fatigue. The suspiring truth is that these feelings of doubt are a natural response to 21st century life. This is because your brain is designed to survive and not flourish. This session will show how your brain is designed to work, why we sometimes doubt ourselves and beat ourselves up, and how we all can begin to build resilience.</p> <p>1. The dominant survival brain – the limbic regions<br/>2. Why dwelling on unhelpful thoughts can become an unhelpful habit<br/>3. The important role of the pre-frontal cortex in being resilient</p> <p>Dr. Jon Finn is the founder and Managing Director of Tougher Minds; passionate about making complex science simple, so that people can use these insights to be their best and help others to be at their best.</p> <p>Much of his current work is helping individuals, teams and managers in London, and the USA, to harness individual and team success in the challenging modern work and societal context. This work includes supporting developers working for banks, investment managers and high-growth start ups to be at their best.</p> <p>Jon has been working in the field of performance psychology and behaviour change for over 17 years. He completed his PhD at Leeds Beckett University investigating the role of emotional regulation in the challenging transitions of some of Britain’s most high-performing athletes.

- name: Software Craftsmanship and Agile & Let's invent a team game!
  description: "<p>Session 1: Software Craftsmanship and Agile</p> <p>In the first half of our evening we will be hosting a debate on the place of Software Craftsmanship within agile practices. This is one for Software Developers who have worked with agile or for those who wonder how they can co-exist.</p> <p>Session 2: Let's invent a team game!</p> <p>Laurence Wood will be leading us this evening on using an iterative approach where you will create, test and refine a new team game. Its aim will be to help teams to continuously improve. It also needs to have useful instructions and informative packaging. The end product will be a shiny new deck of cards designed by you, which we will send to everyone involved for free - fresh off the production line. Delegates can also opt in to be credited as co-creator in the online instructions.</p> <p>We have built the basic framework for a new card game. We have templates to speed things up and our printer is ready to create a professionally presented card deck. The rest is up to you...</p> <p>About Laurence Wood</p> <p>Creator of the Real Roles Agile team game, Laurence inspires teams to deliver more value, more often, using agile and lean in the UK and India. He discovered lean as a Jaguar Cars apprentice in 1988 supervising V12 XJS assembly and studying manufacturing engineering at The University of Birmingham. Ford’s takeover prompted his decision to move fully into IT with RAD (Rapid Application Development) agile pioneers Marks and Spencer in London. Freelance development lead roles followed in South Africa, Austria and the UK, including at Coca Cola and South African Airways. He later became a development manager then divisional head of IT in the demanding City of London investment banking arena. Now Yorkshire-based, he likes to inspire agile leaders to deliver more value more often.</p> "
