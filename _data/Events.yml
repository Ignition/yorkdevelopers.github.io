- name: Running a cluster in the Cloud and ATM Fraud detection with Kafka and KSQL
  description: "<p>Join us for an Apache Kafka meetup on January 10th from 6.00pm, hosted at the brand new Sky Betting and Gaming offices in Leeds. The address, agenda and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:00pm: Doors open<br/>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Networking, Pizza and Drinks<br/>6:30pm - 7:15pm: ATM Fraud detection with Kafka and KSQL, Robin Moffatt, Confluent<br/>7:15pm - 8:00pm: Running your own Apache Kafka cluster in the Cloud, Rami Alnawas, Sky Betting and Gaming<br/>8:00pm - 8:30pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----</p> <p>First Talk</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Robin Moffatt</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Robin is a Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle Groundbreaker Ambassador and ACE Director (Alumnus). His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. He blogs at <a href=\"http://cnfl.io/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://cnfl.io/rmoff</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff. Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time.</p> <p>Title:<br/>ATM Fraud Detection with Apache Kafka and KSQL</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Detecting fraudulent activity in real time can save a business significant amounts of money, but has traditionally been an area requiring a lot of complex programming and frameworks, particularly at scale. Using KSQL, it's possible to use just SQL to build scalable real-time applications.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll look at what KSQL is, and how its ability to join streams of events can be used to detect possibly fraudulent activity based on a stream of ATM transactions. We'll also see how easy it is to integrate Kafka with other systems—both upstream and downstream—using Kafka Connect to stream from a database into Kafka, and from Kafka into Elasticsearch.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Second Talk</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Rami Alnawas</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Rami is a Sheffield University Graduate with an M.Sc. in Information Systems, having worked in software development and operations across both the telecom and finance industries previously. He has since gone on to join Sky Betting and Gaming where he has embraced the DevOps movement across different tribes working within SBG. Hobbies and interests include going to the Gym, undertaking DIY at home and studying towards gaining new certification and acquiring new knowledge.</p> <p>Title:<br/>Running your own Apache Kafka cluster in the Cloud</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We happily run multiple Kafka clusters on-premises with a variety of workloads and requirements. As the business continues to leverage the awesomeness of the cloud, we have been tasked to build a cluster for one of our squads. The purpose of this is to help them integrate with third-parties and provide a consistent hybrid architecture. This presentation will walk you through this journey, outlining the challenges we faced and how we overcome those challenges.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Don't forget to join our Community Slack Team! <a href=\"https://launchpass.com/confluentcommunity\" class=\"linkified\">https://launchpass.com/confluentcommunity</a><br/>If you would like to speak or host our next event please let us know! community@confluent.io<br/>NOTE: We are unable to cater for any attendees under the age of 18. Please do not sign up for this event if you are under 18.</p> "

- name: ACCU York [Jan 2019] - Option(al) Is Not A Failure
  description: "<p>We have the honor to welcome Phil Nash to ACCU York. Phil is the author of the C++ test framework, Catch2 and command line parser Clara. As Developer Advocate at JetBrains he's involved with CLion, AppCode and ReSharper C++. More generally he's an advocate for good testing practices, TDD and using the type system and functional techniques to reduce complexity and increase correctness. He's previously worked in Finance and Mobile as well as an independent consultant and coach specialising in TDD on iOS.</p> <p>Abstract: Error code returns were bad so we invented exceptions. Much better we said. Then we realised exceptions had their problems - with 52% of a recent ISO survey's respondents saying they were banned on all or part of their codebases! We've been trying to patch them up how we can (with noexcept, for example) - but most of the problems are systemic.</p> <p>So there's been a return to error codes. But now we have new features in the language (arithmetic data types, including variant and optional) - and the promise of more coming (expected, outcome?) - that bring us closer to the best of both worlds - although, perhaps, with different compromises.</p> <p>But there's more. Where do error_code and error_condition fit in? What's all this about monadic binding? A try keyword? What do other languages that are further down this road do and what can we learn from them?</p> <p>This talk will be a tour of the past, present, and possible future of C++ error handling; the trade-offs and rationale for each piece and a discussion of where to go next and what we can do as a community to get there. We'll look at a number of in-flight proposals, and include up-to-the-minute status on them following the most recent standards meeting.</p> "
