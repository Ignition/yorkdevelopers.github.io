    Unlimited Training* 

    Now you can enjoy unlimited training from Omni212.

    Any course published by Omni212 on eventbrite with *Asterisk* on the course title can be taken individually as well as a part of the Unlimited training program.

    These are the terms and conditions:


    Unlimited training periods consist of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively. See appropriate ticket type for price.

We'll then split into smaller groups to work on the issues and just see how it pans out.</p> <p>Since we'll having laptops around (feel free to bring your own) why not also show us what you're proud of or bring along an issue that's currently making you scratch your head, we'll try to help!</p> "
