    Unlimited Training* 

    Now you can enjoy unlimited training from Omni212.

    Any course published by Omni212 on eventbrite with *Asterisk* on the course title can be taken individually as well as a part of the Unlimited training program.

    These are the terms and conditions:


    Unlimited training periods consist of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively. See appropriate ticket type for price.
