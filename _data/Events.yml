Our presenters will demonstrate multiple software and their links to Revit, which include: Revit Live, Lumion and Enscape. They will provide live, \"fake\" (not real projects) models to demonstrate the real world, practical applications for visualization within Revit and Beyond!\nCome explore these different software options and obtain a better understanding of the different types, as well as the benefits of 3D visualization. Incorporating these software options into your daily workflow will help you achieve real time updates, exportable walkthroughs, easy software maneuvering, and basic graphic controls; not to mention the compatibility with Oculus rift technology. \nMake sure to reserve your seat now by registering. We hope to see you there!\n\n\n\n***Plus, details for 2017 Rendering Contest will be revealed!\n\n       Richard Carter Warfel Construction Company Director of Virtual Design & Construction      Cat Conlin Beers   Hoffman Architects BIM Manager   \n"

    PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE AGILE CERTIFIED PRACTITIONER (PMI-ACP)® EXAM PREP COURSE FAQ

    AN INTRODUCTION TO THE (PMI-ACP)®

    In the mid 1990’s, the Agile development process emerged as an alternative to traditional plan-driven project management methodologies. Plan-driven methodologies had worked well for small projects with a limited scope of work and few variables, but as the IT industry evolved, development projects grew increasingly more complex. Agile ascribes to the principles of lean development, which emphasizes efficiency in order to optimize the delivery of value to the end customer. The pillars of Agile processes are laid out the Agile Manifesto as follows:


    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

    Working software over comprehensive documentation.

    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

    Responding to change over following a plan.


    More generally, Agile emphasizes flexibility, nimbleness and adaptability. It is also iterative as opposed to cyclical, delivering capabilities to customers incrementally and mitigating risk relating to project scope and schedule uncertainty. Agile is now increasingly embraced as the development process of choice for project managers. Gartner estimates that 80% of all software development projects will utilize Agile methods by the end of 2012. Accordingly, the PMI® is now offering a new Agile certification — the (PMI-ACP)®. If you’re a project manager with Agile experience, you will demonstrate your knowledge of how Agile is applied and practiced. This certification is designed to verify project managers’ mastery of Agile principals and processes, validating their existing expertise to companies looking to adopt the Agile methodology.

    HOW IS THE (PMI-ACP)® DIFFERENT FROM OTHER AGILE/SCRUM CERTIFICATIONS?

    If you are new to Agile, Omni212 recommends first taking our Scrum master certified course. For project managers in the IT industry, learning the fundamentals, terminology, practices and principles of the roles of the Scrum Master or Scrum Team Member is a great introduction to the larger Agile framework. Additionally, there is no experience prerequisite for the Certified Scrum Master exam, which consists of 25 questions and is administered on a “no fail” basis. By contrast, the (PMI-ACP)® is specifically designed for Project & Program Managers, Product Owners, Scrummasters, Scrum Product Owners, Agile Coaches, Agile Trainers, Sr. Developers, Business and IT Managers with extensive experience in multiple Agile methodologies (Scrum, kanban, XP, lean, DSDM, TDD, ATDD, etc.). General project experience is required in addition to Agile-specific experience and education. The exam is designed to test both the practitioner’s level of professionalism in Agile practices of project management and professional versatility in project management tools and techniques. 


    WHAT ARE THE (PMI-ACP)® REQUIREMENTS?

    To see if your project management experience satisfies the eligibility requirements, first download and review the (PMI-ACP)® Handbook. You can also Register for free, which you’ll need to do eventually to apply to take the exam. The site a great tool, with lots of additional resources and information on other PM certifications. Pages 7-8 of the PMI ACP Handbook provide a detailed explanation of the specific education, experience, and project management study prerequisites that must be met to qualify for the exam.

    1. Project Management Experience


    Minimum of 2000 hours of general project experience.

    Minimum of 12 months of project management experience (gaps in experience and overlapping experience will not be counted). Each month in which you worked on multiple, overlapping projects (projects that ran simultaneously) counts as one month toward the total requirement.

    All applicable experience must not date back further than five years from the application submittal date.


    2. Agile Project Experience



    Minimum of 1500 hours of Agile project experience.



    Minimum of 8 months of Agile project experience (gaps in experience and overlapping experience will not be counted). Each month in which you worked on multiple, overlapping projects (projects that ran simultaneously) counts as one month toward the total requirement.



    Agile project experience not dating back further than three years from application submittal date.



    3. Training in Agile Practices


    Minimum of 21 contact hours of formal education (Professional Development Units) in Agile project philosophy, methodologies, principles and practices (one contact hour is equivalent to one actual hour of training or instruction received).

    There is no timeframe associated with this requirement; therefore, candidates can document all Agile project management education, regardless of when it was accrued. Coursework must be complete at the time of examination.

    Courses, workshops and training sessions offered by one or more of the following types of education providers:


    A. PMI® Registered Education Providers(R.E.P.s)*

    B. PMI® component organizations*

    C. Employer/company-sponsored programs

    D. Training companies or consultants (e.g., training schools)

    E. Distance-learning companies, including an end-of-course assessment

    F. University/college academic and continuing education programs


    Self-directed learning (e.g., reading books, watching instructional videos or sessions with coaches or mentors) does not qualify.



    (PMI-ACP)® EXAM DETAILS

    The exam is comprised of a total of 120 multiple-choice questions — 20 of which are pretest questions that do not affect the score. Computer-based testing is the standard method for PMI® certification exams, although paper-based testing is available in certain situations. The time allotted for the exam is three hours. Exam questions are divided evenly — 50% Agile tools and techniques and 50% knowledge and skills. The Agile tools and techniques covered include: Communications; Planning, monitoring and adapting; Agile estimation; Agile analysis and design; Product quality; Soft skill negotiation; Value-based prioritization; Risk management; Metrics; and Value stream analysis.
