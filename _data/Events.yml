  description: '<p>This is a free event, open to all. There will be some beers, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and food provided. We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The talks</p> <p>✩ Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns (@SamBurnsUK)</p> <p>This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture. Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages. We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.</p> <p>✩ Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell (@JasonBruce88)</p> <p>Starting as a Junior Developer can be both exciting and overwhelming.

- name: The Game Has Changed with Jeff Patton
  description: "<p>About the session</p> <p>We all know how fast technology changes. But, we sometimes fail to understand how fast our process needs to change to keep up. This talk is about how 21st century software development has thrown out most of the process assumptions you might have originally learned. In this talk, Jeff Patton will explain how Product Thinking, Lean Startup Thinking, and Continuous Delivery has fundamentally changed how we design and build software.</p> <p>Agenda for the evening:</p> <p>● 18:30 - Networking, food and drinks<br/>● 19:00 - Talk<br/>● 20:15 - More networking and drinks<br/>● 20:30 - Departure</p> <p>About Jeff</p> <p>Jeff makes use of over 20 years of product design and development experience to help companies create great products.</p> <p>Jeff started in software development in the early 90s as a project leader and senior developer for a small software product company. There he learned that well written code, and fast delivery isn’t the secret to success, it’s just table stakes. It’s actually deep understanding of your customers and users coupled with a desire to create a product that’s really valuable to them that makes the biggest difference.</p> <p>In 2000 Jeff worked as a product manager at one of the first companies adopting Extreme Programming. It was there he built a strong appreciation for the discipline that Agile thinking brings to software development and a deep concern for what seemed to be left out, specifically good product thinking. Since then Jeff has been an evangelist championing the inclusion of strong product design and user experience practice in Agile development. Today Jeff teaches and coaches a contemporary blend of practice that incorporates Lean and Lean Startup and Design Thinking all directed at helping organizations build products their customers love.</p> <p>Jeff’s a Certified Scrum Trainer, and winner of the Agile Alliance’s 2007 Gordon Pask Award for contributions to Agile Development. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.</p> <p>User Story Mapping - Book Giveaway</p> <p>We'll be giving away a copy of Jeff's excellent \"User Story Mapping\" book to a lucky person picked at random on the night at the meetup.</p> <p>*agileYork supports <a href=\"http://diversitycharter.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://diversitycharter.org</a> *</p> <p>** Special thanks to our host Hiscox (@HiscoxUK) for their generosity and support **</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group!

    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees.
