  description: '<p>This is a free event, open to all. There will be some beers, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and food provided. We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The talks</p> <p>✩ Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns (@SamBurnsUK)</p> <p>This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture. Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages. We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.</p> <p>✩ Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell (@JasonBruce88)</p> <p>Starting as a Junior Developer can be both exciting and overwhelming. Hopefully we can help you avoid common pitfalls and help you be a more confident developer, sooner rather than later.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Timings</p> <p>18:30 – Turn up, have a drink, a snack, and a chat (food, soft drinks, beer, coffee)<br/>19:00 – Avoiding Common Pitfalls as a Junior Developer - Jason Bruce-Halliwell<br/>19:30 – A little break<br/>19:35 – Tests Make Good Architects - Sam Burns<br/>20:10ish – Pop over to the pub for a chat and a drink</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform (<a href="https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/" class="linkified">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/</a>) – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
