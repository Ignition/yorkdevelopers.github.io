- name: How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help those living with Parkinson’s
  description: >-
    Speaker(s):  Professor Stephen Smith, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are influencing our everyday lives - finding the quickest route home, predicting what we might want to buy and even finding us the perfect partner - but can it also help those living with Parkinson’s?  Parkinson’s is a devastating condition that affects 1 in 100 of those over 60 and currently has no cure. It costs the UK over £2 billion per annum and numbers are set to rise as we all live longer.

    In this lecture we will see how evolutionary algorithms, a form of machine learning, can help diagnose and monitor Parkinson’s, assist in the prescription of medication, and find new drugs to slow or even halt this debilitating condition.

    This talk will be preceded by a drinks reception in P/T/005A in the Exhibition Centre at 5.30pm  - open to all ticketholders.

- name: Women in Tech Presents Future Tech
  description: >-
    Welcome to Women in Tech York's FutureTech event!

    We are a community of like-minded people, studying, working or interested in technology. Our goal is to run events in which we can share our knowledge and interests as well as encourage and empower one another. This event is not exclusive to women; we welcome anyone passionate about tech and increasing diversity in the field.

    Our theme this month is Future Tech and there will be a free buffet (vegetarian and vegan options avaliable) thanks to our sponsors Isotoma and Mitrefinch.


    Event Timings:

    18:00: Registration Opens

    18:30: Introduction

    18:40: Quantum Computation: From Strange Physics To The Computers Of The Future - Rosanna Nichols

    Quantum mechanics displays some truly strange phenomena: for example, superposition, where a particle can be in several “states” (with different properties such as positions or energies) at once. This quantumness is incredibly fragile and hidden to our clumsy, classical eyes but manifests itself at the microscopic level. If we can construct computers to manipulate and exploit these phenomena then a radically different way of computing becomes possible. This is the realm of quantum computing.

    This talk will cover what superposition really means and why this could provide an advantage in computing. We’ll see what algorithms have already been developed, including a closer look at some of the simplest, and how they compare to their classical equivalents, as well as how they are starting to be implemented at an experimental level.

    19:15: Buffet

    19:45: AI: Friendly Helper or Job-Stealing Menace? - Ian Smith, Head of Innovation at ROQ

    Ian will talk about AI, what it is and isn’t, and how it might impact on software delivery (with a particular interest in testing/quality).

    20:30: Networking

    21:00: Event close



    Giveaway!

    As it's Halloween this month, we'll be giving away an adorable ghost pin, designed by York artist Ellen Stubbings. See more of her great work here: https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/SoCuteCompany. To win, tweet us on the night and make sure to include #WiTYork!

    This month we are also really pleased to announce we will be giving away 5 tickets to the SIAM Conference (https://scopism.com/events/)  thanks to one of our members - details on how to enter will be announced on the night!




    Nervous about attending?

    A WiT York ambassador will be outside Pitcher & Piano to greet you on the night, direct you to our upstairs bar and answer any questions you may have.

    University of York Science Education Group Research Seminar

    Dr Lizzie Rushton, Director of Evaluation, Institute for Research in Schools and Honorary Senior Research Associate, UCL Institute of Education

    The Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS), is charity that works to enable all students, teachers and technicians to have the opportunity to become contributing and valued members of the scientific community. Formally established in March 2016, IRIS enables over 200 schools to access authentic research projects so that students, teachers and technicians can genuinely contribute to and experience the excitement and challenge of science. This is achieved by giving schools access to data, providing support and resources for teachers and technicians and lending scientific research equipment. IRIS supports projects across the range of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) disciplines. This talk will share ways in which IRIS evaluates the impact of this work on participating students and teachers. IRIS’ emerging research into the professional identities of teachers who collaborate with their students in STEM research will also be discussed, focusing on the shift some teachers appear to make from the role of science teachers to ‘teacher scientist’.

- name: Systems Change Thinking - Closing the Loop
  description: "Systems Change Thinking - Creating Value and Closing the Loop from Unavoidable Food Supply Chain Wastes\nWe are delighted to announce an opportunity to attend a free, one-day event on understanding the chemical and environmental benefits of utilising unavoidable food supply chain wastes (UFSCW). Current strategies for dealing with UFSCW are rudimentary and of low value: these include waste to energy (including incineration and anaerobic digestion), animal feed and bedding; composting; ploughing back in to soil; and, least preferably, landfill. \nIn response, this event explores UFSCW as a unique bioresource: a treasure trove of unexploited, bio-based materials and chemicals, with a range of potential commercial applications underpinned by holistic life-cycle thinking.\nThe event will be of particular interest to companies of all sizes wishing to valorise food waste streams as well as academics and policy makers. Particular benefits to attendees include:\n\n\nAn introduction to the new Sustainable Waste Valorisation Identifier (SWaVI)  tool which enables companies to identify and compare different potential valorisation strategies based on economic viability as well as sustainability and technological readiness.\n\n\nA chance to listen to key industrialists, academics and consultants discuss valorisation from not only a company, but also a more holistic supply chain perspective.\n\n\nThe opportunity to hear from leading academic and industrial speakers about the latest, novel, technical approaches to food waste valorisation.\n\n\nThe ability to interact and connect with researchers, industrialists and policy makers interested in collaborative UK and global projects.\n\n\nPoster abstract submission deadline\nThe deadline for poster abstract submission is Monday 29th October.\n\n\nDownload the abstract template form\n\n\nSubmit your completed abstract form to sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk as a word document or share as a Google Doc\n\n\nContributed poster presentations A0 format \n\n\nProgramme\nSession One: Holistic Systems Change (Chair: Professor Shahin Rahimifard, Loughborough University)\nSession Two: Change, Technology and Methodologies (Chair: Professor Timothy Foster, University of Nottingham)\nSession Three: Influencing Systems Change (Chair: Dr Avtar Matharu, University of York)\nLunch and refreshments provided.\nInvited Speakers\nHugh Powell Product Technology Centre, Nestlé\nZainudin Umar Global Food Structure & Ingredient Science, PepsiCo International\nSponsorship\nIf you would like to sponsor or exhibit at the event, please contact sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk for more details.\nWe gratefully acknowledge funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Re-SAUCE project EP/P008771/1) which has contributed to the organisation of this free event."

    During our TEDxYork event we will explore how memories are anchored, how we both engage with and protect ourselves from the world around us, and how technology can affect and reflect different kinds of truth.

    We will explore the realities from the perspective of others who share our world e.g. the humble bumble bee. We will also learn how we can enhance our reality using our senses in different ways e.g. in food and drink. Finally we will discover a new world of choices and consequence, explore the opportunities and threats on the horizon from our accelerating world of immersive and virtual reality, enhanced experiences and artificial intelligence.

    How does our sense of humanity fit with this brave new world and should we be excited or very very afraid!

    Please contact me on heather.niven@scy.co.uk if you have accessibility issues as the venue is a listed building. We would appreciate advance notice if you may need help with stairs.Thank you.

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers

  description: "<p>Network, learn, ask a question, meet other folk, get fed - these are all things that happen at PASS user group events. These events are a really great opportunity to socialise in an informal learning experience.</p> <p>Remember to tell your friends and the people you work with; make sure you register as soon as you can.</p> <p>17.30 – 18:00 – Registration / networking.<br/>18:00 – 19:00 – Using Python in SSMS (Pete Moore)<br/>19:00 – 19:20 – Break (food / drinks).<br/>19:20 – 20:20 – Azure SQL DB migration readiness with Power BI (Steve Morgan)<br/>20:20 – 20:30 – Feedback (via Microsoft forms) then off t’pub.</p> <p>Using Python in SSMS<br/>Using Python from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio</p> <p>The noise started far away: you need to learn Python, it whispered. We ignored it for a while because we could. Besides we were busy, busy architecting databases, busy writing T-SQL and busy learning all of the other stuff on the MS Data Platform. Real data. Then something happened: you could code Python from within SSMS. The whisper had become deafening. This was now part of T-SQL coding. This was us.</p> <p>The Python had infiltrated our world, but what did it mean for us, the SQL folk? Did we need to up-skill? What now? Did we need new technology? Textbooks? New education?</p> <p>Or could we just ignore it? This decade’s LINQ (sorry LINQ folks)? This talk tackles these questions by coaxing Python out of its natural environment and debating the pros and cons of: SQL vs Python, Native Python vs Python in SSMS; and, ultimately, why we might just be able to have the best of both worlds - all from the comfort of your own SQL Server Management Studio.</p> <p>About Pete Moore<br/>Pete is a Data Scientist specialising in R, Python, and SQL. He is the founder of Look at your Data Ltd and available for freelance work*, you can view his CV here: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/rvLhy1\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/rvLhy1</a></p> <p>Prior to Look at your Data, Pete was an IT Director.</p> <p>He is a present-day student at the Data Science MSc at the University of Dundee.<br/>*or permanent work, but it needs to be really, really good</p> <p>Azure SQL DB migration readiness with Power BI</p> <p>Working how ready your SQL estate is to migrate to one of the Azure SQL DB environments is a key decision point in the migration life cycle. In this session I'll be showing you how to use the Data Migration Assistant to interrogate your SQL estate and then present the results in a pre-built Power BI report.</p> <p>About Steve Morgan<br/>Steve Morgan has 20+ years’ experience as a data base engineer &amp; architect with the last 15 focused on Data Warehousing, BI &amp; Analytics. For a large part of that time he was an independent contractor working across many sectors and organisations usually in project recovery scenarios. In September 2017 he joined Microsoft as a Data Platform TSP (that’s Architect to you &amp; me) where he helps customers in the Health Care sector navigate the Microsoft Data Platform technologies both on-premise and in Azure.</p> "

Simon will demonstrate the steps involved and interactions as code moves from commit to production in Azure Devops.</p> <p>Our headline speaker is Simon Westcott a hands-on architect with 10+ yrs experience of building high traffic websites. In late 2016 Simon moved into the world of platform engineering to help re-imagine Sky Betting &amp; Gaming's delivery approach and drive operational efficiency. Delivery agility is key to Simon and his Team's success. As their engineering team grows, they have an increasing number of greenfield products to comission, as well as monolithic applications to decompose into microservices. To manage this they need a platform that can keep pace, both in the cloud and on-premise. Simon will explore with you why they choose Kubernetes, how they're adapting both on AWS and on-premise and the challenges they faced.</p> <p>As an extra treat we'll also be giving away 2 tickets for the upcoming DevOpsDays Edinburgh conference on the 1st and 2nd of November.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
