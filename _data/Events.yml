- name: Global pollution in urban environments
  description: >-
    During this lunchtime seminar, researchers at the University of York will discuss their research into global pollution in urban environments. Confirmed speakers include Dr. Harry Vallack from the Stockholm Environment Institute and Dr. Adam Vaughan from the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL).

    Dr. Harry Vallack, Senior Research Asoociate for Stockholm Environment Institute in York (SEI-Y)

    Harry Vallack is an ecologist specialising in air pollutant emissions inventories, carbon dynamics of plant/soil systems, ambient dust pollution monitoring and issues relating to persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

    Harry has over 25 years experience working on various aspects of air pollution at scales ranging from local to global. This has included capacity building within non-OECD countries (including developing of suitable manuals/software) for the preparation of air pollutant emissions inventories, producing air pollution emission scenario projections for developing country regions.

    Harry’s current research interests concern short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), global change ecology, soil carbon dynamics and capacity building for emissions inventory preparation in developing countries. In the process of this research, he has developed software tools to enable developing countries to compile air pollutant emission inventories. More recently he has helped develop a tool to assist countries prioritise alternative SLCP mitigation strategies, going from emissions estimates through to likely impacts on human health crop production and climate.

    Dr. Adam Vaughan, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL)

    Adam is a postdoctoral researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) since 2017, specialising in urban emission measurements. WACL is the UK’s first dedicated laboratory building for atmospheric chemistry research. Adam obtained his Master’s in Chemistry from the University of Hull in 2013, and his PhD in Chemistry from the University of York in 2017, working with Prof. James Lee and Prof. Lucy Carpenter. His PhD focused on assessing UK emissions from a low flying aircraft. His work led to the first direct assessment of Greater London emissions from an aircraft through eddy-covariance, highlighting that London’s NOx emissions were being underestimated in the National Inventory. Since completing his PhD, Adam has developed a range of techniques for assessing urban emissions through enhanced eddy-covariance methodologies. He has made air quality measurements on multiple global field campaigns and more recently led research in New Delhi measuring vehicle emissions through remote sensing techniques.

    Health in Urban Environments Event Series

    The event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.

    Through a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.

    By bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.

    The series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York.

  description: "Air pollution, its all over the news and all over our cities, but what do you really want to know about it?  Come along to find out about air quality research at the University of York, how it relates to this beautiful city and where it impacts on our everyday lives. Take the opportunity to quiz experts from the University and York City Council on all things air pollution, and consider the simple things that can be done to help improve the air we breathe.\nHosted by the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York, this event aims to raise awareness of air pollution issues - particularly in York - ahead of Clean Air Day (20th June), the UK’s largest air pollution campaign.\nAbout the speakers\nDr David Carslaw is a Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York. His research is focussed on developing a better understanding of urban air pollution, particularly around emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Much of his work is aimed at better quantifying vehicle emissions under urban driving conditions. Another area of focus is the development of receptor modelling approaches to improve understanding of the influence of different emission sources on ambient concentrations. \nAlastair Lewis is Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York working within the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories. He is also currently Deputy Director of, and Director for atmospheric composition, at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). He has participated in over 30 major atmospheric science field projects, from polar regions to tropical oceans, city centres to remote forests. He is a member of a number of expert advisory groups including for Defra, the World Meteorological Organisation and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nLiz Bates is a University of York alumni employed as a specialist air quality officer at City of York Council and City of Bradford MDC. She helped develop the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) and Low Emission Strategy (LES) for York and has a specialist interest in low emission planning. She helps to co-ordinate Clean Air Day activities in York.\nHealth in Urban Environments Event Series\nThe event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.\nThrough a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.\nBy bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.\nThe series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York."

- name: 'Alex Bellos: The World’s Favourite Number'
  description: >-
    Maths writer Alex Bellos was so sick of being asked for his favourite number that he started to ask everyone else the same question. More than 40,000 responses later he had a treasure trove of data. In a talk that includes mathematics, psychology and the history of science, Bellos reveals the curious patterns behind our emotional responses to numbers - what they say about us, and what’s important about them.

    About the Author

    Alex Bellos is an author and broadcaster who specialises in mathematics and Brazil. When he was the Guardian's correspondent in South America he wrote Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life, a look at contemporary Brazil seen through football.

    He is also the author of the popular math books Alex's Adventures in Numberland and Alex Through the Looking-Glass, which were both bestsellers in the UK. Alex writes a maths blog and a puzzle blog for the Guardian and frequently speaks on maths at conferences, festivals, in schools and in companies.

- name: 'Sustainability Metrics: Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II'
  description: >-
    Aim of the workshop

    Measure and monitor your supply chain’s performance with appropriate and easy-to-use sustainability metrics. Existing industrial sustainability metrics primarily focus on the chemical process, although the need to consider the performance of a “bigger picture” is prevalent and growing. This workshop is dedicated to demonstrating current trends and practices in applying qualitative and quantitative sustainability evaluation practices, through use of LCA and other industrial best procedures.

    Context There is a current need for innovative business models that are sustainable and resource efficient to meet with fast-approaching and stricter environmental targets. Reducing, neutralising or going negative with carbon emissions in any process is a challenge, regardless of the sector. Creating a circular economy could be the ideal solution to overcome this challenge. Undertaking these responsibilities to the highest accuracy, extensiveness of this reporting and transparency among stakeholders are currently some of the major hurdles. Some enterprises have, however, been successful. With a view to creating a dialogue and awareness of the various methods of tracking and reporting these sustainability characteristics, in portfolio management, systems thinking to end of life management strategies, the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence is organising a “Tracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation II” event.

We'll cover how OIDC builds on top of OAuth, the basics of the OAuth Implicit flow, what JSON Web Tokens are, and some recent changes in the guidance around securing SPAs</p> <p>Luke Oliff (@lukeocodes) - Building a Deployable React Client and Express Backend-For-Frontend<br/>A backend-for-frontend is a service specifically built to be consumed by a frontend application. General purpose backends are typically built alongside clients for their needs. As more clients with more features need access, your originally focussed backend can become more monolithic in size and design. One way to avoid this runaway design is to introduce a backend for each client with only relevant features. I'll show you how to produce a backend-for-frontend Express application that hosts it's own React client, so the entire stack can be built and deployed together.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no active recruitment policy, outside of the job pitches at the start of the event.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "

  description: "<p>Good quality air is important. After all, everyone breathes. But dig a little deeper into the subject and most of what you find is what we don't know. Is air pollution produced by local traffic? Does it waft in on the breeze? Are there times when I really shouldn't go out for a run?</p> <p>In this talk I'll describe how you can build your own connected air quality sensor and get data from it. I'll touch on embedded devices (including the IoT DevKit) the MQTT protocol, LoRa networking, Azure IoT Hub and Azure Functions, along with the Connected Humber effort to spread sensors over Humberside.</p> <p>Rob Miles</p> <p>Rob Miles spent over 30 years teaching programming to a succession of students at the University of Hull in the UK.

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
