- name: Building a better computer
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Jim Austin, Department of Computer Science

    Computer Science Lectures

    Building computers is a complex task, relatively inefficient, resulting in power hungry systems that untrained individuals cannot alter without some risk to the computer and to themselves. There must be a better way to do this that would make lives easier for everyone.

    Jim Austin has been working on a new concept in computing for over 17 years. Inspired by his immense collection of computers (www.computermuseum.org.uk) he felt it was time to take a fresh look at how we physically build a computer system – this has involved him in a wide range of subjects including, Computer Architectures, Computer networking, 3D topology, chemistry, 3D printing, Manufacturing, Design, physics – a fascinating and challenging journey.

    The idea stems from the basic concept of removing everything from the computer apart from the chips that drive it. The solution started out with a small plastic ball containing the chip which communicates and is powered without wires – throw a pile of balls into bucket and you have your computer – A Ball Computer (ABC).

    The practical conclusion of the ABC idea resulted in the COOL Computer, which will be demonstrated and the story of the journey in reaching the practical solution presented.

- name: Workshop on Data-Driven Video Storytelling @ The University of York
  description: >-
    Perspective Media: Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement is an EPSRC funded research project exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society. In collaboration with our partners BBC R&D, The Open Data Institute, The Digital Catapult, City of York Council, BAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen and others, we aim to exploit the power of video storytelling for engagement and literacy with data, and the potential of data analytics to reveal new opportunities for storytelling.

    To kick-off the project, we are hosting a 1-day research workshop at the University of York. This workshop will bring together academics, stakeholders from the creative industries and experts in data engagement to explore the opportunities and challenges posed by data-driven video stories. We will begin by sharing and discussing our research vision and plans. The remainder of the day will then be dedicated to the hands-on, experimental development of ideas and concepts for Perspective Media content, and the interrogation of those ideas in terms of the aesthetic, practical and ethical challenges they reveal. The workshop is the first in a series of activities that will be held over the next 18 months, including hackathons and the collaborative production of experimental content. We hope that you can join us to explore the potential of this exciting new content form.

    We hope that you will be able to join us in York!

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Two: Writing for an Off-World Colony '
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \nSign up to join us!\n\n\n\nWorkshop Two: Writing for an Off-World Colony\nYou are leaving Earth to set up the first off-world colony.  What things would you take with you?  This creative writing workshop asks you to debate this question by looking at stories by some of the great science fiction writers.\nFollowing the popularity of the Festival of Ideas creative writing workshop with the same title, the editors of Terra Two will offer the workshop again, this time with a specific invitation to staff and students as well as members of the public. Staff and students who are interested in working together to facilitate Terra Two workshops in local schools and community venues may find this of particular interest. All are invited to begin creative work which can be submitted to Terra Two: An Ark for Off-World Survival for the next submission deadline, which is the 1st of April. \n\n"

- name: 'Laboratory Astrophysics : Bringing the universe back down to Earth - Dr. Andrew Higginbotham'
  description: >-
    From planets to supernovae, the universe is filled with exotic and exciting objects.  The fact that we have learnt so much about these distant objects from our vantage point on Earth is remarkable.  However, the fact that traditional astrophysical techniques are typically limited to passive observation places limits on the information we can acquire.  For example, what is the centre of Jupiter made of?  

    In this talk we discuss how experiments utilising some of the world’s largest and most extreme experimental facilities are allowing us to recreate astrophysically relevant conditions in the laboratory.  This relatively new field of “Laboratory Astrophysics" has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of some of the most distant (and unobservable) corners of the universe.

  description: "<p>• What we'll do<br/>Looking forward to seeing you all!</p> <p>If you're interested in hosting or sponsoring please drop us a line.</p> <p>As usual we'll be providing plenty of food and drinks =)</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>Ric Harvey - AWS</p> <p>A look at AWS Fargate and running containers without infrastructure worries. Using Fargate we'll deploy a simple application and show how easy it is to go from zero infrastructure to a running web application without touching a server.</p> <p>AI Deep Dive, a level 300 demo into the AWS Deep learning AMI and Apache MXNet. Apache MXNet is one of the many open source projects AWS actively develops and releases code for. We'll use MXNet to do some image categorisation. We'll also talk about the pro's and cons of doing this yourself vs Amazon Rekognition.</p> <p>Chris Gillespie - Elder Studios</p> <p>Chris comes from a development background, is AWS Certified and currently builds all projects he is involved with on AWS. One of the pain points for recent projects has been the need for interaction with core AWS services during development. In this talk Chris will show us how they have started to overcome this by \"Running AWS locally\".</p> <p>Nico Vibert - VMware</p> <p>VMware and AWS partnered up to build a Hybrid Cloud service called VMware Cloud on AWS which is launching imminently in the UK.<br/>VMware Cloud on AWS is an on-demand service that lets you run VMware vSphere-based applications on the AWS infrastructure.<br/>This session will provide an overview of VMC on AWS, the use cases and some innovative demos on how both technologies can complement each other.</p> <p>---</p> <p>We'll likely also repeat the group Q&amp;A session from last time as this worked well - your peers are your friends when it comes to getting answers to tricky problems!</p> <p>Under 18’s are also welcome under adult supervision - we can't be held responsible for them but if they're interested in AWS and DevOps feel free to bring them along. This does come with the caveat that there will be alcohol (no, they can't have any but they can have pizza!) and it is at Sky Betting and Gaming's offices so there are likely to be some references to gambling.</p> <p>---</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>• Access statement<br/>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and general car parking. There is a designated quiet space by request at the event. There isn't a hearing loop, or a bsl interpreter.</p> "
