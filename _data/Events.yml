The underlying goal is to understand our materials, challenges and processes, and share that knowledge so our Business Units can learn from each other and avoid making the same mistakes.  This year's Keynote Speaker is Blake Moret, Chairman and CEO, Rockwell Automation. \nOur labs are outfitted as well (if not better) than the best television crime solving shows. This is advanced science and it all relates to chemistry – how the materials that become our products (or used in making our products) are sourced, applied and supported. \n5 Reasons to Attend\n\n\nLearn what’s new in forensic analysis – what we know and are learning about our materials, why they work and why they fail. \n\n\nSave time and effort. Don’t repeat mistakes. Talk to colleagues and find out what they’ve learned, and apply it locally. \n\n\nHear stories from the ‘bizarre and strange’ file. A little levity you don’t want to miss.\n\n\nMeet your colleagues. They can help you. \n\n\nGet key messages straight from leaders (CEO Blake Moret will talk about how materials bring The Connected Enterprise to life).\n\n\nFurther information regarding the goals of RTN and examples of past presentations, can be found by following this link: https://rockwellautomation.sharepoint.com/teams/OESES_ATS/C_ME/SitePages/RTN.aspx\nKeynote Speaker\n\nBlake Moret is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Automation.

As great as our venues are, they have a finite amount of space for attendees.  \nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the conference?\nYes, please bring your ticket as it's your admission to the event and you will need it at check-in. You also can use the Eventbrite app.\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the afterparty?\nIf you attend the conference, present your bundle or separate afterparty ticket when you check in to receive a paper afterparty ticket. That paper ticket will be collected at the gate when you enter the afterparty.\nIf you purchased an afterparty ticket separately without attending the conference, please bring your Eventbrite ticket as it's your admission to the event and you will need it to enter. You also can use the Eventbrite app.\nWhat's the deal with the afterparty?\nIt's at the new SRP Park. There's no game that night. There will be batting cages, giveaways, entertainment, food, drink, stay-and-play tours, and other exciting things. The WOW Club will be open as well. \nThe name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?\nEach attendee needs to have their own ticket in their own name.\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the conference venue?\nThe most convenient way to get to the venue is by car. Parking is available in the gravel lot adjacent to the building and in the Goss Lane Parking Deck, which can be found on the map (just above the Harrison Education Commons): http://www.augusta.edu/maps/images/healthsciencescampus.pdf \nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the afterparty?\nThe most convenient way to get to the afterparty venue is by car.

Overflow parking will be at the North Augusta Municipal Building.\nWhat can I bring to the conference?\nBring a laptop if you plan to participate in the CTF or a workshop. \nWhat is the refund policy?\nSorry, there are no refunds.\nI bought a conference ticket and now I want to go to the afterparty. Can I get the bundle deal retroactively on my ticket?\nNo. If you think you might want to go to the afterparty, buy the bundle for $10 more. Even if you don't go, proceeds from your purchase will help us make the event even better.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe (the BSidesAugusta Board of Directors) are collecting your data only for BSidesAugusta registration/notification/capacity planning purposes.

In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on, and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how “Web 2.0” represented not only the resurgence of the web after the dot com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the internet as a platform. In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

Physicians, scientists, NIH leaders, pharmaceutical industry experts, patients, and patient advocacy groups will come together to identify new research paths and priorities for advancing promising translational research. Proceedings will be published in Science Translational Medicine. A complimentary continental breakfast will be provided both days and a complimentary boxed lunch will be provided the first day.

- name: Beers with Engineers - VMworld Updates!
  description: >
    Didn't get to Vegas this year for VMworld? Come out to Platypus and get the low down on the latest updates from the undisputed leader in the Software Defined Data Center.

     

    Some of the big announcements this year:

     


    DataFrameworks acquisition


    DataFrameworks ClarityNow! product integrates with Isilon and ECS to provide a unified file system view across primary and archive storage. This lets end users find, use and organize files on-prem and in teh cloud.


    VxRail finally has a G series node built on Dell C-series servers


    The 2U/4N VxRail G560 aligns the full VxRail family with the latest generation PowerEdge portfolio. The G560 delivers greater density and outperforms the previous VxRail G Series with: 1.75x more and faster cores, 100% increase in processing power; 4x more memory, and 3x capacity increase improvement in the boot device.


    VMware Cloud Assembly


    Cloud Assembly is a multi-cloud provisioning service. Cloud Assembly provides an abstraction layer across multiple clouds. This abstraction normalizes infrastructure constructs without sacrificing the richness from each of the clouds.


    VMware vRealize Code Stream


    Code Stream is primarily a continuous delivery service for DevOps and developers. It includes many pre-built continuous integration plug-ins for development tools (e.g. Git, Jenkins) and orchestration systems (e.g. Kubernetes). Whereas Cloud Assembly automates infrastructure or application deployments, Code Stream improves productivity by automating the deployments though various stages leading unto production.


    Unity VSA - Cloud Edition


    The Unity VSA can now be deployed with VMware Cloud on AWS and have up to 256TB filesystems. Note that we (Dell EMC) only suggest using it for test and development or for disaster recovery in the cloud.


    VMware Cloud on AWS


    VMware Cloud on AWS received a big shot in the arm at VMworld 2018 with a 50 percent price cut that partners say will dramatically accelerate adoption of the cloud service.


    VxRail Stretch Clusters to the Cloud


    If this isn’t cool, I don’t know what is. VxRail VVD (VMware Validated Design) will soon support distributed multi-availability zones architecture and multi-site deployments with disaster recovery. More details to come.


    VxRail is now part of the Dell EMC’s Future-Proof Loyalty Program

    VMware Cloud Foundation


    VMware Cloud Foundation makes it easy to deploy and run a hybrid cloud. VMware Cloud Foundation provides integrated cloud infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, and security) and cloud management services to run enterprise applications in both private and public environments


    Pat Gelsinger's badass tattoo


    Say what you will about it but that man has some serious commitment to the future of VMware. I guess it is safe to say they wont be changing the logo any time soon (and yes, its real). https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/virtualization/vmware-ceo-pat-gelsinger-s-keynote-5-boldest-statements-at-vmworld

- name: "Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series: Talithia Williams"
  description: >-
    Join West Virginia Science & Research for the next installment of the Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series at our new location: the Culture Center at the state capitol complex in Charleston. Dr. Talithia Williams is a groundbreaking professor, popular TED speaker, inspiring author and passionate STEM/STEAM advocate. A host of the PBS series, NOVA Wonders, she has made it her life's work to get people of all ages and backgrounds excited about the bold possibilities of a STEM education and to “STEMpower” women and minorities to enter these professions. Her latest book, Power in Numbers: The Rebel Women of Mathematics, reflects Williams’ passion to re-brand the field of mathematics as anything but dry, technical or male-dominated. Renowned for her popular TED Talk, “Own Your Body’s Data,” she advocates for all of us to deploy data as a way of taking charge of our own health. A vibrant, engaging and energizing speaker, Dr. Williams demystifies data, statistics, probabilities and the mathematical process in amusing and insightful ways. She also passionately champions the contributions of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians and their vital role in transforming our future.

    Dr. Williams is associate dean for research and experiential learning and associate professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, where she develops statistical models which emphasize the spatial and temporal structure of data, and applies them to real world problems. Focused on data analytics, mathematics, statistical modeling and STEM Outreach, she is the first African-American woman to achieve tenure at the college. She hosts NOVA Wonders, a PBS mini-series that explores the biggest questions on the frontiers of science. The Los Angeles Times praised the show for sending the message “that scientists come in a range of ages, genders, colors and hairstyles.” She also appeared in NOVA’s Prediction by the Numbers, a series exploring the history of probabilities and gambling which Forbes called, “an entertaining, fun piece that conveys her knowledgeable and deep interest in this predictive method.” In addition to her teaching and television work, she has partnered with the World Health Organization in developing a cataract model used to predict the cataract surgical rate for countries in Africa. Her professional experiences include research appointments at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA’s Johnson Space Center, and the National Security Agency.

    An exceptional communicator and gifted teacher, Dr. Williams won the Mathematical Association of America’s Henry L. Alder Award for distinguished teaching. She also developed a 24-part college level lecture series on learning statistics for The Great Courses, an online platform for lifelong learners. Dr. Williams earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Spelman College, a master’s degree in mathematics from Howard University and a Ph.D. in statistics from Rice University.

    Described by audiences as engaging, relevant, funny, accessible, and a joy to work with, Dr. Williams captivates and inspires with her contagious enthusiasm for STEM in general and math in particular. Applying the data-driven approach made famous in her TED talk to a range of subjects, she takes sophisticated numerical concepts and makes them understandable to a wide audience, debunking perceptions with an energizing call to “show me the data!”PARKING: Culture Center visitor parking is free on evenings and weekends. You may park in the metered lots on the Capitol Complex without “feeding the meters.” On weekdays, parking in these lots is available, but you will need to bring quarters for the meters. Additional visitor parking is available at Laidley Field on Elizabeth St. BOOK SIGNING: Dr. Williams’ book will be available for purchase at the event courtesy of Taylor Books. Her signing will immediately follow the program.

After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>We have two amazing talks lined up for you this month!</p> <p>Our first speaker is Callum Whyte, a senior .NET developer for The Cogworks in London. He is currently leading the team building an app to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy for the NHS utilising some of the latest tech: Xamarin, microservices with Azure Functions and .NET Core.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>How do you scale an over engineered monolith intended for millions of users?<br/>How do you fix bugs and add new features to a codebase that's impossible to understand?<br/>How can you avoid rewriting everything yet make the application perform as it was intended?<br/>How do you do all of this while the app is LIVE and being used by many users every day?<br/>The answer: restructure it into small maintainable chunks – microservices!</p> <p>Callum will discuss the process he followed to transition an app for the NHS into a majestically constructed microservices architecture, the lessons learnt and pain points felt along the way.</p> <p>We'll take a look at the infrastructure components you can use with limited knowledge to get started using microservices, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway to build a large API.</p> <p>Finally we'll take a look into the code and have a look at the iterative changes we had to make to ensure our old monolithic app could scale, such as building a new authentication \"service\" based on IdentityServer and restructuring specific components into Azure Functions!</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tom Parrish, one of Crisp's Senior Developers. C# is constantly evolving so you can write the most advanced coding of your career. With C#8 rumoured to launch later this year, Tom will guide you through the key features and share ideas on how you can use them in 2019.</p> "

- name: How to parse a file and Kotlin for the curious
  description: "<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, \"How to parse a file\" and \"Kotlin for the curious\" both being presented by Matt Ellis.</p> <p>**How to parse a file**</p> <p>Yes, we're going to look at file parsing. Sounds a bit boring, right? Wrong.</p> <p>In this talk, just for fun, we'll find out how to parse a file. We'll look at simple, handcrafted parsers. We'll finally figure out just how lex and yacc work. And we'll pick apart structured parsers that build abstract syntax trees as you type - ReSharper style. How is an IDEs parser different to a compiler? How do you handle sensible error recovery? What about significant whitespace?</p> <p>Everything you always wanted to know about parsing a file, but were too afraid to ask.</p> <p>**Kotlin for the curious**</p> <p>Interested in Kotlin? And why not - it’s a pragmatic language designed to remove ceremony, solve real world problems and still feel familiar to newcomers. It can target the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native code, even running on iOS. That’s a lot of reach for a single programming language.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll go on a high level, introductory tour of Kotlin - how to get up and running, what Kotlin looks like, and how to write idiomatic, concise code - functional or object oriented. We’ll look at data classes, top level and first class functions, inlining, null safety and more, including the design decisions behind some of the language choices. We’ll see how you can build DSLs, with examples from Android and HTML, and look at how we can build multi-platform projects. And we’ll take a look at coroutines, Kotlin’s answer to C#’s async/await.</p> <p>**Bio***<br/>Matt Ellis is a developer at JetBrains, working on the Developer Advocacy team. He has 20+ years of experience shipping software, having been a developer, team lead and technical authority for companies such as BBC Worldwide, BNP Paribas and Egg, the UK’s first internet bank. During that time, he has worked with a variety of platforms and technologies, from C++ and Unix to C#, Reactive Extensions and the Web. He currently works with language tooling, having fun with abstract syntax trees and source code analysis. He owns and contributes to various open source projects, and believes in the open closed principle.</p> "
