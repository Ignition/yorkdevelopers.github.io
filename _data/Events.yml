- name: 'The Central PA RUG Meeting: Streamline Project Management with Bluebeam'
  description: "Collaboration is the new buzz word as construction projects become increasing complex in dealing with numerous parties through conception, design, and building. This month’s meeting will provide an overview of the software tool Bluebeam and how it facilitates working with all the different entities within a construction project.\nFrom the design perspective, you will learn how you can host virtual meetings that enable remote project partners from across time zones to collaborate online – in real time. Replicate a conference room setting, but instead of face-to-face, do it in a digital environment.\nYou will also learn how you can export your 3D design from Revit to create a 3D PDF. See how you can mark-up the PDF to easily communicate with others in the project chain who don’t have access to Revit.\nMoving from design to construction, learn how the presenter’s company leverages Bluebeam for real-time, in-the-field communication. Construction teams have immediate access to the most up-to-date plans. RFIs are answered more quickly reducing costly down time.\nRegister by December 11th to attend in person or tune-in virtually.\n       Doug Galloway Erdman Anthony Senior Mechanical Designer   \n"

- name: Lightning Talks & Thinking Functionally in C#
  description: "<p>This will be our 3rd donetYork meetup, and we're going to be running a few lightning talks and then a talk on Thinking Functionally!</p> <p>- MongoDB - Kevin Smith (@kev_bite)<br/>- Custom Visual Studio Analysers - David Betteridge (@da_betteridge)<br/>- Using .NET in PowerShell - Chris Gardner (@halbaradkenafin)</p> <p><br/>- Thinking Functionally - John Stovin (@johnstovin)</p> <p>The determined programmer can write FORTRAN programs in any language - Ed Post</p> <p>To program effectively in a functional language, you need to discard many of the thought processes and habits that you have developed for coding in ‘curly bracket’ languages, and understand a new set of idioms and ways to think about code.</p> <p>In this session, John will talk about some of those fundamental idioms, explain why they exist and how they interact to provide a very different framework for thinking about your code. Even if you never write any F#, these ways of thinking can be used to make your C# code more efficient and more robust.</p> <p>He will also discuss some C# libraries that you can use to apply functional principles to your existing C# code.</p> "

- name: 'December 2017: Alex Carter - Containerisation Hack of a Legacy Software Solution'
  description: '<p>Alexandra Carter - Callcredit, Numero and Microsoft: Containerisation Hack of a Legacy Software Solution</p> <p>This is the story of how we took a legacy solution and pushed it into containers on windows in just three days. This was also a great chance to work with Microsoft at the cutting edge of their work on containerisation, VSTS and Azure. Moving on from our Hackathon, we have continued adding new components, experimenting with orchestration and showcasing our work. I’ll talk you through the prep work, the 3 day hack and the subsequent work; what it means for the product roadmap, the experimentation we have done and how stakeholders are responding. Finally, we’ll look ahead to next steps.</p> <p>Case study: <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/devops/2017/06/16/Callcredit_DevOps.html" class="linkified">https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/devops/2017/06/16/Callcredit_DevOps.html</a></p> <p><br/>Alex Carter</p> <p>"I have worked in IT, Marketing, Software Support and Software Delivery before moving into my current System Build (DevOps) role within Callcredit. I live and breathe DevOps and am currently focussing on anything around containerisation in Windows.
