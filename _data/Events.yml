- name: LeedsDevops - May 2019 Meetup
  description: "<p>Spring is well and truly here and on Tuesday 21st May 2019 so are we at the ODI Node in Leeds for fresh devops thoughts.</p> <p>* 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>* 7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>* 7:25 - 8:05 : Non Toxic Work Environments<br/>* 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>* 8:20 - 9:00 : Serverless Chaos<br/>* 9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>We start this meetup with a different knid of talk, as we know a large part of devops is about creating a culture of trust, callaboration and empathy with our fellow colleagues. Alex Stanhope – Cloud Architect &amp; DevOps Consultant from Lightenna in our first talk of the evening \"Non Toxic Work Environments\" describes that stress can be a fantastic healthy way to experience new challenges, grow and learn but without the right context, support and respite it can do real harm. In this session he'll look at the things we can all do to keep our workplaces happy and productive.</p> <p>Our second talk of the night is a duo from DAZN, Mick Roper and Tom Lloyd. Mick is a Software engineer and architect with 10 years experience. Worked in businesses of all shapes and sizes and is the un-crowned king of the summer bbq. Tom is a engineer at Dazn with a background in functional Scala microservices and modular React apps. He has previously worked for Sky on their Sky Mobile launch, as well as their identity services. In his spare time, you’ll often find him on a mountain or watching old films.</p> <p>Their talk \"Serverless Chaos\" discusses how chaos engineering is becoming a core competency required by teams to ensure that their users get the best experience of the product, but how do you apply chaos engineering approaches to Serverless architecture? In this talk they will explain the problem and demonstrate the solution to Serverless Chaos.</p> <p>First Time Attendees</p> <p>Here at LeedsDevops we understand that coming along to your first meetup can be an anxious experience, walking into a large room full of people can be daunting. So when you arrive at the meetup we'll have an additional small room for new attendees to make friends with other first time attendees. Then shortly before the start we'll show you into the main room helping make the whole experience less intimidating (but honestly there's nothing to worry about the LeedsDevops crowd is a friendly bunch). We'll also use this room as a quiet space between the talk for those that don't want to join the discussion.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>We're continuing to expand the range of refreshments on offer, there will be a wide range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees, water, craft beer, cider and wine - big thanks to our sponsors [Infinity Works](<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an [anti harassment policy and code of conduct] (<a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct</a>) in order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

- name: Ministry of Testing Leeds - May 2019
  description: "<p>Hot on the heels of the April meetup, we've organised some great speakers for May. The theme for May will be more technical and automation based.</p> <p>6pm - 6.30pm: Networking and food</p> <p>6.30pm - 7.15pm: TALK: Testing Kafka - Lessons learned testing a Kafka based application with Jest and NodeJS - Colin Wren (@colinwren)</p> <p>7.15pm - 7.30pm: Break</p> <p>7.30pm - 8.15pm: Where we’re going, we don’t need roads - Scott Kenyon (@Testing_Scott)</p> <p>8.30pm - Pub (Editor's Draft)</p> <p>Here are the speaker and talk details:</p> <p>COLIN WREN:<br/>Having been a developer for 8 years, Colin jumped over that fence developers love to chuck work over six months ago to became an SDET with interests in automation, the visualisation of test report data and value driven development practices. Outside of work Colin loves augmented reality, Pokemon Go (for which he helps run the Leeds community), death metal and board games.</p> <p>Testing Kafka:<br/>Having spent the last 6 months testing a Kafka based application, Colin gives a short introduction to what Kafka is, how it’s used and shares his experience of writing an end-to-end test framework using Jest and NodeJS.</p> <p>SCOTT KENYON:<br/>Scott is at the start of his testing journey having become a full time tester in August 2018. Coming from an analytical and technical support background he is very inquisitive and always willing to help others. He has embraced the testing mind-set and mythology having been thrown in at the deep end by his mentor Ady Stokes (don’t worry he had arm bands). Quickly developing a passion for testing he also takes part in triathlons and is married with 2 children. A strong believer that diversity in testers is a key benefit he is open about his own autism and anxiety disorder, talking to others about it openly. Currently works as a Test Analyst for Computershare in Skipton North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads:<br/>From the very start my eyes were opened to the testing universe and all the weird and wonderful ways that we can exam software. This lightening talk will share Scott’s journey from the past to the most recent 7 months. How he has evolved and adapted to fit into his own way of testing. He will also share the internal conflict he went through to understand “am I adding enough value?”</p> <p>Thank you to our hosts Infinity Works and our sponsors Fruition IT, FDM Group and Computershare.</p> "

- name: Azure Functions and Container Instances for reduced costs
  description: '<p>In this talk we will go through using Microsoft Azure serverless and container technologies to automate a recurring process and reduce costs. In my work I was required to create a system which repetitively performed actions against web pages. I used selenium with the page object model as the model to interact with the pages, the code was executed using an Azure function which instantiated a browser in an Azure container Instance using a standard docker container. A transient container was used to avoid having to have one permanently installed on a VM, the container could be created only for the time it was needed. As serverless and Azure container instances have a usage charging model the costs were negligible compared to running a dedicated VM for the operation. In this talk I will talk briefly about:<br/>* Selenium and Page Object Model - how it aids re-usability of selenium code<br/>* Azure Functions - the developer experience<br/>* Azure container Instances - what they are and how setup and removal can be automated</p> <p>But mostly how the above fits together to make a great developer experience and deliver a solution at minimal cost.</p> <p>Bio: John Staveley<br/>John Staveley is a developer focusing on web development with 20 years experience, mostly in the .Net stack. He is an organisor at Leeds Sharp and Leeds Data Science meetups and regular speaker on a variety subjects such as security, messaging and typescript across the north of England.

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
