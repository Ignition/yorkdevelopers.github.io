- name: LeedsDevops - October 2017 Meetup
  description: "<p>It's time for our 4th anniversary bash at the ODI Node in Leeds for an evening of spooktacular devops talks and cackling:</p> <p>• 6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>• 7:15 - 7:20 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>• 7:20 - 8:05 : Rightsizing for the Cloud - Bernard Jauregui<br/>• 8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>• 8:20 - 9:00 : Mesosphere 101 - Matt Jarvis<br/>• 9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p><br/>We are delighted to welcome Bernard Jauregui from BJSS, this talk is about Bernard's time as a test lead, focusing on minimising platform overheads. He takes the discussion beyond the obvious concerns of cost; looking at risk, motivation and solution longevity. A well architected cloud solution can meet demand with elasticity, hear about getting a robust approach to right-sizing, potential pitfalls and cloud specific complications. The talk highlights some key considerations:</p> <p>• Metrics for elastic architectures<br/>• Risks and rewards<br/>• Weird outcomes and gotchas<br/>• Effective refactoring of infrastructure as code</p> <p><br/>Our headline speaker for the evening is Matt Jarvis is a developer advocate at Mesosphere, his job is to engage with the communities around DC/OS and Mesos. Matt has spent more than 15 years building products and services around open source software, on everything from embedded devices to large scale distributed systems. Most recently he has been focused on the open cloud infrastructure space, and in emerging patterns for cloud native applications. </p> <p>His talk Mesosphere 101 showcases the Apache Mesos project as a distributed system for running other distributed systems, often described as a distributed kernel. It's in use at massive scale at some of the worlds largest companies like Apple, Netflix, Uber and Yelp. DC/OS is an open source distribution of Mesos, which adds all the functionality to run Mesos in production across any substrate, both on-premise and in the cloud. In this talk, he'll introduce both Mesos and DC/OS and talk about how they work under the hood, and what the benefits are of running these new kinds of systems for emerging workloads. </p> <p><br/>As it's our 4th birthday bash and Halloween we thought we'd introduce a little trick or treat fun - we're going to have a prize giveaway for the best halloween costume, so turn up in your best spooky outfit and the best one will win a small but perfectly formed Raspberry Pi Zero! No one leaves LeedsDevops empty handed so we have commissioned a set of beautifully crafted artisan LeedsDevops stickers, all attendees may take one home and decorate their laptops as they see fit.</p> <p>Once again <a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\">Infinity Works </a>have agreed to sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there is a plentiful supply of our favorite beverages, soft drinks and as it's Halloween a bumper supply of sweets!</p> <p><b>Code Of Conduct</b></p> <p>Please note that we have now added an <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99\">anti harassment policy and code of conduct </a>in order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.</p> <p><b>Venue</b></p> <p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street (not too far from the Adelphi).

- name: Recent excavations at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr
  description: "<strong>Professor Nicky Milner, Deputy Head of Department, Department of Archaeology, University of York<br />\n</strong><br />\nStar Carr is an internationally important Mesolithic site that dates back to roughly 9000 BC. First discovered and excavated in the 1940s it unearthed some extremely rare and intriguing objects, such as headdresses made from red deer skulls and amber beads, which had been preserved in the peat for millennia. The rarity of such objects made the site famous in the archaeological world and many different interpretations were made as to what sort of site it was: e.g. base camp, hunting camp, tanning site, or kill site. From 2004-2015 further excavations took place led by a team from the Universities of York, Manchester and Chester. Although severe deterioration of the deposits had taken place, other rare discoveries were made including more headdresses and an engraved pendant. In addition, three large wooden platforms were uncovered representing the oldest evidence of carpentry in Europe. These important findings have changed the ways in which we understand how hunter-gatherers lived, shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. "
