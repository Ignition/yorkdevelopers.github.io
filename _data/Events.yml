- name: Agile for Motivating and Engagement + The Essence of Scrum
  description: "<p>The Essence of Scrum</p> <p>A talk inspired by Tobias Mayer which looks to describe Scrum through the eyes of a layperson and a software developer in a single talk.</p> <p>Tony shares one of the most popular Agile frameworks that, when well understood, allows the creation of processes that organize complex projects within a team. He discusses the core values of courage, trust, congruity, humility, and a sense of service, and then shares the components for high productivity in a fail-fast environment.</p> <p>These are:<br/>1. Empiricism - creating a feedback loop, vs trying to plan everything up front.<br/>2. Self-organization - based on the premise that the people closest to the problem are best able to know the solution to the problem; allowing them to figure it out for themselves.<br/>3. Agility - valuing collaboration vs comprehensive documentation (in which you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want or need).<br/>4. Focus - being able to move each item from concept to complete, without paying overhead to 'context switching' (which is hugely inefficient).<br/>5. Transparency - banishing fear &amp; suspicion.<br/>6. Rhythm &amp; Ritual - guiding you to a state of flow.<br/>7. Emergence - the best solutions are not created. Rather, they evolve.</p> <p>About Tony</p> <p>Tony Richards is an Agile Coach working on a large scale Agile Transformation at Aviva. Helping teams embrace Agile values and principles through a combination of training, mentoring and coaching.</p> <p>Starting his career in software development working with Toyota. He has worked across utilities, telecoms, finance and public sector. Which also exposed him to Finance, Marketing and Corporate Strategy during this time.</p> "

Combined with the 'Rise of the Module' over recent years that has seen a marked increase in the availability of PowerShell cmdlets and functions, and it's not hard to see why your skill set should include PowerShell. If you think you missed the boat on this, you may be surprised to learn how many people are turning to PowerShell this year as they see the potential and realise how it can boost productivity and ultimately your career. </p> <p><i>In this session, Chris Rhodes MVP, will showcase how PowerShell is more popular than ever, and invite audience feedback and your real world experience to support this trend.</i></p> <p><br/><i><br/></i></p> <p><b> Event topic (2) </b></p> <p><i>All in the cloud: Working without servers</i></p> <p>Can you really remove all your on-premises servers and live purely in the cloud? In this talk, we will investigate the options and parallels that exist for you in public cloud offerings such as Azure and Office 365. We'll also discuss the blockers and how to propose this within your business to free yourself from racks, UPSs and downtime issues that can plague IT departments without losing your job in the process! </p> <p><i>Whether you are all 'in' or you’re working in a hybrid environment today, join us for an interactive talk about the future of IT.</i></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Event details</b></p> <p><br/>July 26th 2017<br/>6.00pm - 9.00pm</p> <p>The Cross Keys Pub<br/>107 Water Lane<br/>Leeds<br/>LS11 5DW</p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Tickets are free, but please book a ticket so that we can plan food and refreshments.

- name: July - Chad Gowler & Martin Nyaga
  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p>Over half way through the year and we've had a load of fantastic speakers so far and we'll be bringing you more as the year goes on. This month we've got 2 great talks and we'll be giving away a ticket to the <a href=\"https://www.dotjs.io/\">dotJS</a> conference!</p> <p>First up we have Chad Gowler (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitation\">@kitation</a>) who will be giving a talk titled \"Mental Health in the Tech Industry\". Mental health is a hugely important yet ignored thing in our industry so I'm excited to have Chad talk for us!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Chad:</p> <p><i>\"Mental health is something that will affect most of us. The tech industry is high-paced and high pressure, and this means that we may be leaving some developers to struggle. This talk will examine touchpoints such as meetings, code review and timesheets and think about ways that they could cause difficulty. We will think about how we can make them easier to navigate so that developers can get back doing to what they do best.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we have Martin Nyaga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Martin_Nyaga\">@Martin_Nyaga</a>) with a talk titled \"State Machines in Javascript: What, Why &amp; How\". I'm not from a computer science background so initially I thought the talk may be too heavy for those like me, but after chatting to Martin it sounds like a great talk for everyone!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Martin:</p> <p><i>\"Finite State Machines are a large area of focus in theoretical computer science, but are rather underutilised outside of CS101. Without going deep into mind-numbing computational theory, this talk explores a bit about what they are and how they can be practically useful in day to day web-development, using a real life Javascript example. I’ll also explore some of the javascript tooling available. This talk is suitable for people with CS and non-CS backgrounds alike.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w3nc7HPVD3srV3MMi1iQV-Zj2Ojnb5XvdX7U5g6f_7Wl1xFGNE_gbzoiAwxZdOjLieTEqb18YHaAwWUra4Yx0RjA1QFN4QqFbnE4G5EyzBvXCAEMPuUA9tBA1kw5bqucz3_FHfhJ</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
