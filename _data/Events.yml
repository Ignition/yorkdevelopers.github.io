    The World's Largest DevOps Event,June 5 - 7, 2018at the Javits Center in New York, NY!

    The widespread success of cloud computing is driving the DevOps revolution in enterprise IT. Now as never before, development teams must communicate and collaborate in a dynamic, 24/7/365 environment. There is no time to wait for long development cycles that produce software that is obsolete at launch. DevOps may be disruptive, but it is essential.

    The @DevOpsSummit at Cloud Expo - to be held June 5-7, 2018, at the Javits Center in New York, NY - will expand the DevOps community, enable a wide sharing of knowledge, and educate delegates and technology providers alike. Recent research has shown that DevOps dramatically reduces development time, the amount of enterprise IT professionals put out fires, and support time generally. Time spent on infrastructure development is significantly increased, and DevOps practitioners report more software releases and higher quality.

    Join @DevOpsSummit Chair June 5-7 for three days of intense DevOps discussion and focus.

  description: >+
    Tickets go on sale March 1st, 2018 at 1:59 PM EST

     

    What is Stir Trek: 2018 Edition?

    Stir Trek: 2018 Edition is our tenth iteration for the Stir Trek conference. As before we're stirring web, mobile, client, and cloud development topics together along with quality, security, soft skills, design, and user experience content to present a fun day of learning. There will be eight tracks of sessions, breakfast, lunch, and a private screening of Avengers: Infinity War, which opens in theaters the day of the event - May 4th, 2018.



    What Topics Are Being Covered?

    The Stir Trek website lists the current Schedule, Sessions and Speakers that we have confirmed.



    What Does It Cost?

    In order to cover the significant costs of a large scale event like this one, there will be a $125 fee for attendance. This will be the best $125 you spend this year, however. Take a look at what you get.



    What Do I Get?

    It is our goal to bring you significantly greater value than your $125, and here’s how we intend to do it:


    Registration materials mailed ahead of event

    48 sessions of critical content

    Well-known regional and national speakers

    Lunch and Breakfast

    Attendee T-shirt

    Private screening of Avengers: Infinity War at the end of the day

    Refreshments during the movie



    How Many Tickets Can I Order at Once?

    Like previous years, you can order up to 20 tickets in one order.  If you need more than 20 tickets for your team, you will need to place multiple orders.  Please make sure that you include the appropriate name, address, and t-shirt size for each person you're buying a ticket for.  There's nothing more disappointing than receiving an awesome box from a conference and getting a shirt two sizes too small.



    How do I know what size t-shirt to order?

    We have creating sizing charts for our shirts to help you get a feel for which size will fit you best.  We offer both m

    en's and women's styles, so make sure you pick the cut that you prefer.




     Can I Buy Another Movie Ticket?

    Like our previous events we will be offering a limited sale of additional movie passes at a later date.  Registered conference attendees will be notified when additional movie passes are available for purchase.  Once these additional passes are sold out we can not offer any more.

  description: >-
    Join The Data Incubator and Databricks co-founder, Matei Zaharia, Ph.D for the next installment of our free online webinar series, Data Science in 30 minutes: Infrastructure for Usable Machine Learning.

    Abstract:  Despite incredible recent advances in machine learning, building machine learning applications remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for all but the best-trained, best-funded engineering teams. This expense usually comes not from a need for new and improved statistical models but instead from a lack of systems and tools for supporting end-to-end machine learning application development, from data preparation and labeling to productionization and monitoring. In the Stanford DAWN project, we are developing a set of tools to make these processes easier, from weak supervision approaches to dramatically reduce the need for labeled data, to query-specific model specialization to reduce serving cost, and end-to-end ML systems that encapsulate a complete task and greatly simplify the interface to the user.

    About the speakers:

- name: 'Trottier Symposium: Planning for Resiliency in the Face of Climate Change'
  description: "\nThe 5th annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy and Design\n\nPLANNING FOR RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\nEngineering and design for sustainability are an essential part of a multi-faceted response to climate change particularly in urban centres, which may include increasing our resiliency in the face of extreme weather events, changing our water management practices, or adapting our cities and infrastructure to an unpredictable future. There is a need to identify robust strategies for responding to the challenges brought by climate change through adaptation, reorganization, and evolution. Our response to climate change must include solutions that allow our socio-ecological systems to not only survive, but thrive.\nThe 2018 5th Annual Trottier Symposium on Sustainable Engineering, Energy, and Design will focus on resilience and human responses to the threats brought on by climate change, while considering the following questions:\n\nWhat is resilience and why is it so important to ensure sustainability in the context of urbanization and climate change?\nHow can we be more resilient to disruptions such as extreme weather events, floods, drought, sea level rise, and heat waves? What solutions are being imagined, developed, and implemented?\nHow can infrastructure be protected and self-renewed following extreme weather events or other stresses exacerbated by climate change?\n\n\nSpeakers\nThe symposium is a free, public event, featuring prominent speakers on each day of the 2 day event. \nApril 4th - Day 1 - 6pm to 8pm\nGuy Nordenson, Professor of Structural Engineering and Architecture, Princeton University School of Architecture\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nPippa Brashear, Director of Planning and Resilience, SCAPE\n\nDESIGNING FOR RESILIENCE: ECOLOGY + ENGINEERING + ENGAGEMENT\n\nTranslating the ideas of resilience into realizable actions and implementable designs can be challenging. We are forced to design with uncertain and incomplete information for an environment that is changing around us. However, the need for action and innovation is urgent, and success requires collaborative and interdisciplinary action. This presentation explores the process that has taken one innovative coastal resilience project from conceptual idea to the later stages of design and the lessons learned about integrating and implementing physical, ecological, and social resilience on the way.\n\n\n\nAlan De Sousa, Borough Mayor of Saint-Laurent and City of Montreal Councillor\nTITLE OF PRESENTATION TO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nApril 5th - Day 2 - 6pm to 8pm\nKaren Seto, Professor of Geography and Urbanization Science, Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\nHOTTER, WETTER, DRIER: GLOBAL TRENDS IN URBANIZATION AND CHALLENGES FOR RESILIENCE\nThis talk will focus on global trends in urbanization and exposure to climate change impacts. It will highlight extreme climate events around the world - bomb cyclones, wildfires, floods, droughts - and how future urbanization may increase risk and vulnerability to these hazards.\n\nPhilippe Gourbesville, Professor Hydroinformatics and Water Engineering, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis\nRESILIENCE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CITIES\nDuring the last decade, urban development has reached new submits with generation of mega cities that concentrates several millions of inhabitants. Those new urban environments represent unknown challenges for modern societies that are still using – implicitly or explicitly – the same concepts for urban development since millennia. Sustainability of urban centres is today a major priority that has to be approached in a holistic way. The size of cities requests to rethink and review some of the engineering concepts that are currently used and to shift from the centralized approach to the distributed and connected paradigm. At the same time, gradual sophistication of urban environment has generated a significant increase of global vulnerability regarding extreme weather events that are frequently affecting urban communities. \n\nMore Information: http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables\n\nVers une Stratégie de Résilience Face aux Changements Climatiques \n En matière de développement durable, l’ingénierie et la conception sont des éléments essentiels à une réponse multidimensionnelle au changement climatique, particulièrement dans les centres urbains. Il pourrait s’avérer nécessaire d’augmenter notre résilience dans le contexte des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, de changer nos pratiques de gestion des ressources en eau ou d’adapter nos villes et nos infrastructures pour faire face à un avenir imprévisible. Nous devons donc définir de solides stratégies pour répondre aux défis entraînés par les changements climatiques, grâce à l’adaptation, à la réorganisation et à l’évolution. Notre réponse aux changements climatiques doit comprendre des solutions qui permettront non seulement à nos systèmes socio-écologiques de survivre, mais également de prospérer.\nLe 5e Symposium Trottier annuel sur l’ingénierie, l’énergie et la conception durables, édition 2018, porte principalement sur la résilience et les réponses humaines aux menaces qui découlent des changements climatiques, tout en se penchant sur les questions suivantes :\n\nQu’est-ce que la résilience et pourquoi est-il si important d’assurer la durabilité dans le contexte de l’urbanisation et des changements climatiques?\nComment pouvons-nous faire preuve d’une plus grande résilience aux perturbations comme les phénomènes climatiques extrêmes, les inondations, les périodes de sécheresse, l’élévation du niveau de la mer et les vagues de chaleur? Quelles solutions sommes-nous en train de concevoir, d’élaborer et de mettre en œuvre?\nComment pouvons-nous protéger les infrastructures et comment celles-ci peuvent-elles s’autorenouveler sous le coup des phénomènes climatiques extrêmes ou des autres stress aggravés par le changement climatique?\n\n\n\nConférenciers\n\nÉvénement public gratuit, le symposium présente des conférenciers de renom durant les deux jours du symposium. Les présentations seront données en anglais. \n  \n\n4 avril – 1re journée – de 18 h à 20 h\n\nGuy Nordenson, professeur, ingénierie structurale et architecture, école d’architecture de l’Université Princeton\nPippa Brashear, directrice de la planification et de la résilience, SCAPE\nAlan de Sousa, Maire d’arrondissement Saint-Laurent et conseiller de la ville ensemble Montréal\n \n\n5 avril – 2e journée - de 18 h à 20 h\n\nKaren Seto, professeure, géographie et études en urbanisme, école de foresterie et d’études environnementales de l’Université Yale \nPhilippe Gourbesville, professeur, hydro-informatique et ingénierie de l’eau, Université Nice-Sophia-Antipolis\n \nPour en savoir plus : http://www.trottiersymposium.org/\n\n"

- name: Undoing the Future, a lecture by Karen Barad
  description: 'The indeterminacy of time-being at the core of quantum theory troubles the scalar distinction between the world of subatomic particles and that of social phenomena such as colonialism, capitalism, militarism, racism, nationalism and environmental destruction – all of which are entangled with nuclear and particle physics research. Quantum physics is a material-discursive practice with direct ties to the military-industrial complex, and while it gave birth to the atomic age, quantum physics disrupts classical Newtonian physics (which has its own troubled legacy in the service of war, colonialism, capitalist expansion, and empire building), including its foundational notions of space, time, and matter. In the annual Roslyn Silver ’27 Science Lecture, Karen Barad takes up quantum physics’ immanent deconstructive dynamics, consider ways in which quantum physics troubles modernist conceptions of time, and ask whether quantum temporalities might offer radical political imaginaries for cohabiting this planet more justly by undoing the future.Karen Barad is Professor of Feminist Studies, Philosophy, and History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, she co-directs the Science & Justice Graduate Training Program, funded by the National Science Foundation, which “trains science and engineering students alongside social science and humanities students to identify and respond to moments where research requires attentiveness to questions of policy, ethics, and justice.” She has a doctorate in theoretical partical physics and is the author of author of Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning.Details and AccessibilityThis event is free and open to the public. The venue is accessible to people with mobility disabilities. Please contact BCRW for additional accessibility needs.'

- name: James Briscione Evening Lecture
  description: >-
    THE TALK: The Flavor Matrix

    A groundbreaking ingredient-pairing guide, The Flavor Matrix shows how science can unlock unheard-of possibilities for combining foods into astonishingly inventive dishes. Briscione distills chemical analyses of different ingredients into easy-to-use infographics, and presents mind-blowing recipes that he’s created with them. The result of intensive research and incredible creativity in the kitchen, The Flavor Matrix is a powerful tool for home cooks and professional chefs alike. Join James as reveals the trials, failures and successes that led him to creating The Flavor Matrix. 

    James Briscione is the first two-time champion of Food Network’s Chopped, a regular host and judge on Food Network, the Director of Culinary Research at the institute of Culinary Education (ICE), celebrity chef and one of People Magazine’s ‘Sexiest Chefs Alive 2016.’ He is the author of four books: Just Married & Cooking (Scribner ’11), Cognitive Cooking with Chef Watson (Sourcebooks ’15), The Great Cook (Oxmoor House ’15) and The Flavor Matrix (HMH ’18). As an instructor at one of the world’s top culinary schools, James Briscione thought he knew how to mix and match ingredients. Then he met IBM Watson while developing ICE’s Modernist Cuisine. From 2012-2014, he worked with IBM and the “Chef Watson” team to help understand how flavor compounds and ingredients translate from a database to the real-world kitchen. Working with the supercomputer to turn big data into delicious recipes, Briscione realized that he (like most chefs) knew next to nothing about why different foods taste good together. That epiphany launched him on a quest to understand the molecular basis of flavor—and it led, in time, to The Flavor Matrix. The food and ideas that James created with IBM have been featured in the New York Times, The New Yorker, NBC, BBC, NPR, Time and hundreds of outlets around the globe.

- name: Who is to blame for our lack of Agile progress?
  description: '<p>Who is to blame for our lack of Agile progress?</p> <p>The answers of course lie in the system and the underlying thinking of the organisation. There is no person to blame as we often look for with command &amp; control thinking.</p> <p>About Rachel Whitaker</p> <p>A decade of systems thinking experience and the joyful learns and successes which have come with that have only increased Rachel’s passion to share that experience with others. 95% of the performance of any system can be attributed to the system conditions, NOT the individuals in the system.</p> <p>Rachel has applied systems thinking principles at Aviva and outside of Aviva with colleagues in all areas of the business finding the same thinking producing the same results over and over again. Once you start systems thinking, you can never go back.<br/>Rachel is passionate about great customer experience, continuous learning, awesome colleague environments and systems thinking.

But there are other coding horrors that should trigger alarm bells whenever we see them, whether in a legacy codebase or when doing code reviews. Like a good horror movie, coding horrors should scare us when we find them, because they’re often symptomatic of deeper problems. So let’s take a short tour of some of the greatest horror movies ever made (and a few turkeys); and some of the most worrying code horrors that I’ve seen."</p> <p>Mark is ZCE; Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak; Coordinator of Open Source PHPOffice library suite (PHPExcel, PHPPowerPoint, PHPWord, &amp;c); Trainee cat herder.</p> <p>✩ A journey into API performance and security using PHP Silex<br/>Blair Garrett <a href="https://twitter.com/blairguk" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/blairguk</a></p> <p>"I’ll take you through the practices, tools and techniques I employed when making my best attempt to secure and speed up API’s. For this talk I’ll be using the PHP Silex framework. I’ll go through the reasons for my choice of tools which you can lean on. These will ensure your API goes like the clappers and the bad guys can’t get in. This is loosely based on a read world example.

Digital transformation is the latest phrase, but what does it actually mean? Claire is going to talk about the changes that are needed at the personal and organisational level for digital transformation to actually deliver results, and how the VeriSM approach has been written to help.</p> <p>Or second speaker is Bob Walker, Bob is one of the organising team behind DevopsDays London and claims to have been doing devops since before it was called devops and has been doing on call longer than that. bob is currently working at dxw as System Operations Engineer but has been the Supreme Ruler of the YAML engineers at the UK Government Digital Service and has only recently stopped being on call for GOV.UK.</p> <p>Bob's talk is \"Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview\" - Ever wondered how best to respond when an interviewer asks if you have any questions? Drawing on his experience from both sides of the table, bob offers some suggestions for questions which will not only make you look well-prepared but also help you decide whether you want to work there.</p> <p>We are again grateful to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
