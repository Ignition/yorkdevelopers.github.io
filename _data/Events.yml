- name: agileYork - The Essence of Scrum
  description: "<p>The Essence of Scrum</p> <p>A talk inspired by Tobias Mayer which looks to describe Scrum through the eyes of a layperson and a software developer in a single talk.</p> <p>Tony shares one of the most popular Agile frameworks that, when well understood, allows the creation of processes that organize complex projects within a team. He discusses the core values of courage, trust, congruity, humility, and a sense of service, and then shares the components for high productivity in a fail-fast environment.</p> <p>These are:<br/>1. Empiricism - creating a feedback loop, vs trying to plan everything up front.<br/>2. Self-organization - based on the premise that the people closest to the problem are best able to know the solution to the problem; allowing them to figure it out for themselves.<br/>3. Agility - valuing collaboration vs comprehensive documentation (in which you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want or need).<br/>4. Focus - being able to move each item from concept to complete, without paying overhead to 'context switching' (which is hugely inefficient).<br/>5. Transparency - banishing fear &amp; suspicion.<br/>6. Rhythm &amp; Ritual - guiding you to a state of flow.<br/>7. Emergence - the best solutions are not created. Rather, they evolve.</p> <p>About Tony</p> <p>‎Tony Richards is an Agile Coach working on a large scale Agile Transformation at Aviva. Helping teams embrace Agile values and principles through a combination of training, mentoring and coaching.</p> <p>Starting his career in software development working with Toyota. He has worked across utilities, telecoms, finance and public sector. Which also exposed him to Finance, Marketing and Corporate Strategy during this time.</p> "
