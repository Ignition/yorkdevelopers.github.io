- name: Logging, Metrics and Events in ASP.NET Core
  description: "<p>Providing decent monitoring of your applications has always been considered the boring part of development, with tons of boilerplate code, and making upfront decisions around how it will be done, or retrofit afterwards. However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it's never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production.</p> <p>In this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other.</p> <p>We’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate.</p> <p>We’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information. Finally, we'll look at Honeycomb.io and how they're providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production.</p> <p>Martin Thwaites<br/>VP Engineering @ MAG-O</p> <p>Martin is the VP of Engineering @ MAG-O, the Online arm of Manchester Airport Group.

The following presentation will delve into how MS PowerApps and the use of Flow can revolutionise one’s business processes - all of which are developed with the strength of the applications themselves to perform the heavy technical lifting, thus allowing IT teams to focus on enhancing the overall User Experience (UX).</p> <p>The discussion will focus on a real world example highlighting the business problems faced, the hurdles and complexities that were overcome and the overall solution that MS PowerPlatform provided to streamline the business and its operations.</p> <p>The talk will show the processing of taking a business process from data capture using a sophisticated MS PowerApp, a range of automation and background processes using the power of MS Flow and lastly the use of PowerBI to gain an understanding of the companies big data.</p> <p>Session Two : The State of Compliance and Records Management in SharePoint Online &amp; Office365 - Paul Gallagher (Independent Consultant)</p> <p>In this session, we will take a tour of the tools in SharePoint Online and Office 365 to help organisations develop and implement an information governance strategy across archiving, retention, disposition, supervision and records management and why your organisation might want to use them. We'll also look at some of the new cross-service functionality recently added to Office365 such as content search improvements, SEC17-a4 labels, Microsoft Information Protection and the File Plan tool that enables enterprises to define and maintain a File Plan in the Cloud and publish retention labels to the Advanced Data Governance Service in the Security and Compliance Center.</p> "

- name: The Clean Architecture by Ian Cooper
  description: "<p>Ian Cooper - The Clean Architecture</p> <p>What is the clean architecture and how you would build one in .NET? Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures, including hexagonal architecture, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that, in the bulk of the presentation, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET. From first steps to working code, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core</p> <p>Twitter: @icooper</p> "

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
