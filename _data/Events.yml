- name: LeedsDevops - May 2018 Meetup
  description: "<p>In the words of Thomas Dekker, it's the Merry Month of May, which means it's time for another devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 15th May. We bring you a terrific lineup :</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Introduction to Google Cloud Platform<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : You had one job - Failures in a complex distributed system<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>Our first speaker is Richard Rose who is a lead platform engineer with over 20 years of experience working on complex infrastructure and software architecture. As a founder of the Leeds Google Developer Group, he is very interested in all form of technology, especially Cloud and Android. In his spare time, he loves to read and experiment with different technologies.</p> <p>Richard’s talk is an introduction to Google Cloud Platform and discusses the highs and lows of working in a Google-centric universe versus the more well-publicised market competitors. Depending on your perspective (developer or operations) you may be surprised by the approach taken by Google and also at the range of packages on offer within this environment. The talk will cover the primary components of using the platform and offer some advice on getting started, general architecture patterns and where to go when it all goes wrong.</p> <p>Speaking of stuff which breaks. It’s one of the basic fundamentals of IT, but there are some things you expect to just work. But what happens when these things decide to let you down, especially when part of a large distributed system?</p> <p>Our second talk is from Ed Hiley and Dan Rathbone who offer an overview of the technical renaissance going on in parts of the NHS, where things are being done in a modern way. Ed and Dan explore a recently launched data processing system that utilizes Apache Spark, Riak, and Python and discuss the events they encountered along the way where things they took for granted just stopped doing the things they expected. Ed and Dan dive into some of these events to debunk the assumptions they made and explain how they troubleshot and fixed the issues.</p> <p>Edward Hiley is a principal systems engineer with NHS Digital, where he has worked on national services such as SUS+, a ground-up full replacement of the current Secondary Uses Service (SUS), which involves myriad challenges, including immutable infrastructure, disputed compute clusters, and multi-data-center deployments.</p> <p>Dan Rathbone is cofounder and technical director of Infinity Works, a 200-strong consultancy and software house based out of Leeds and London, where he builds and operates high-scale and high-performance systems for Infinity Works’ clients. Most recently, Dan has been working with NHS Digital to drive the modernization of critical national services, reengineering them using FOSS, end-to-end DevOps teams, and Agile and Lean delivery techniques.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any LeedsDevops event are required to agree with the code of conduct.</p> <p>Venue</p> <p>The ODI Node Leeds is situated at Munro house, on Duke Street (not too far from the Adelphi).

  description: "<p>This is a free event, open to all. There will be some beers, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and food provided.

While it's not a revolution, there's lots of things included that make our life much easier and more fun! Symfony was moved closer to industry practices with application bundles gone, simplified directory structure, or environment variables preferred over configuration parameters.</p> <p>Both versions 2 and 3 has already introduced some nice features, like autowiring, that contributed to what Symfony 4 has become. As a result there is less Symfony specific concepts and more standard practices. It's easier to learn, easier to configure, easier to install and deploy, and finally easier to master.</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, our workflow was much improved with the introduction of Symfony Flex, a new way to install and manage Symfony applications. It's time to say goodbye to both Symfony installer and the Standard Edition!\"</p> <p>Jakub Zalas is an independent software consultant, architect and trainer, who helps teams to deliver software that survives change.
