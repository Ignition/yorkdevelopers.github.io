     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS FOUNDATION

    Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 17.5 million deaths each year. Cardiovascular disease may strike those in their prime years and, due to population aging, also afflict elderly people who are otherwise living healthy lives. Improvements in cardiovascular therapy have markedly reduced procedural risk, and thereby enabled the treatment of a broad range of patients, more than ever before in the history of medicine. Nonetheless, significant disparities in the delivery of cardiovascular care continue to exist, leading to large unmet clinical needs for many patients worldwide. Innovation in the delivery of cardiovascular care, as well as education of the public at-large, is essential for optimizing the management of these patients.


    The Cardiovascular Innovations Foundation is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    The mission of the Foundation is to address unmet needs in cardiovascular care through the study, design, and development of innovative health care solutions and education of health care providers and the larger public.

- name: "Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series: Super Cells with Nina Tandon (Rescheduled) "
  description: >+
    This event was originally scheduled for Thursday, April 19, and postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. If you had planned to attend and would still like to, please register again on this page.  From clay and stone to plastic and steel, basic building materials have always shaped our physical world and our sense of possibility. Now we are at the cusp of exploring and exploiting a new substance so groundbreaking that it challenges our very notion of what it means to build. This new material is: life.

    In this keynote, Nina Tandon takes us on an eye-popping tour of the tantalizing array of inventions already being created with nature’s elemental building block, the cell. Imagine the possibilities: broken bridges that have the ability to self-heal, one-stop body-shops for human body parts that render organ donation obsolete, living looms spinning high-tech fabrics, PETA-friendly porterhouse steaks—smarter, more adaptive technologies that may form our future arsenal as we confront looming challenges. With great enthusiasm, Tandon contends that we’re entering a new technological revolution, one in which we can create smarter technologies by making cells our partners in design—often on our own steam, in collaborative biohacking labs. And, she confront the thorny questions that come with playing with the power of life.

    Nina Tandon is CEO and co-founder of EpiBone, the world’s first company growing living human bones for skeletal reconstruction as well as the co-author of Super Cells: Building with Biology, which explores the new frontier of biotech.

    A TED Senior Fellow (she’s spoken at three different TED conferences) and Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Cooper Union, Tandon has a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from the Cooper Union, a Master’s in Bioelectrical Engineering from MIT, a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, and an MBA from Columbia University. Her PhD research focused on studying electrical signaling in the context of tissue engineering, and has worked with cardiac, skin, bone, and neural tissue.

    TeacherCon is a free multi-day experience for Canadian educators in the K-12 school system, as well as student teachers and teacher leaders who want to inspire kids to be builders – not just consumers - of technology through coding activities and challenges. TeacherCon will provide how-to guides, hands-on training, lesson-planning tools, mentor support and access to an educator community for sustainable support and collaboration.Takeaways from TeacherCon will include Teacher Guides, access to an online lesson-planning platform, community support for afterward.We’ve combined our experiences teaching thousands of youth across the country to code, our tips and tricks to get started, resources to familiarize yourself with code, plus lots of easy to follow and even easier to implement coding activities to empower and teach the future generation of technologists across Canada.Let's shape how technology education is introduced in schools across the country - together!Agenda:


    Introduction to the “why’s” of Coding

    Exemplars of Coding Projects and Lesson Plans

    UnPlugged Coding Activities (no computer required)

    Why Teach Code?Technology is everywhere and it’s not going anywhere. Teaching kids to code is about more than just helping children understand the technology they are using and secure employment in the future. At a fundamental level it improves problem-solving and thinking skills.We think it’s important for youth to learn to code for a few reasons:


    Coding is a superpower. Learning to code let’s kids build -- not just consume the technology around them like video games, websites, robots and more.

    Coding helps kids develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that gives kids a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships or jobs - they are valuable skills that are in high demand.

    Coding helps kids understand the world around them better. If we teach biology and mathematics in order to understand the world around them, then knowing the basics of how computers communicate - and how to engage with them -should be a given.

    Coding can help change the world empower kids to use technology as a creative tool to build solutions for problems or challenges people face everyday.

    Coding is fun! We want kids to experience the satisfaction and thrill of building something of their very own.



    Conference Dates:

    This conference will run over the course of three days; Tuesday, August 7th from 9:30am - 4:30pm, Wednesday, August 8th from 9:30am - 4:30pm, and Thursday, August 9th from 9:30am - 4:30pm. Breakfast will be served beginning at 9:00, Workshop begins at 9:30 AM.

Being able to influence this type of testing in a positive manner is a skill that testers will need to get to grips with, as more companies start to embrace a model of lone testers in cross functional teams. The shift of focus from primarily the testing that testers do, to the testing that the team does, is a key shift in thinking and behaviour.</p> <p>To facilitate this shift, I believe testers busting their own illusions about this aspect of building something good would bring us much closer to developers, and help us realise what other layers of testing can cover most effectively. The last point is pertinent here, as knowing and guiding unit testing brings the role of integration, acceptance and exploratory testing into sharp focus.</p> <p>This is a topic that has always intruiged me, having predominantly worked as a single tester on a team for the last five or so years. I reached out to the community with the question \"What do testers believe about unit testing?\" and received a lot of engagement. The good users of Twitter added another 50 or so illusions that testers might have about this layer of testing. I figured that based on that level of engagement, maybe this would make an interesting talk! It wasn't only testers who responded too, suggesting that there might be some shared illusions about unit testing that are cross discplinary.</p> <p>The growing list intruiged me, so I wrote a blog with the raw list, it can be found here <a href=\"http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/testers-guide-to-myths-of-unit-testing.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://testingisbelieving.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/testers-guide-to-myths-of-unit-testing.html</a></p> <p>The list alone is interesting but now I would like to share my analysis of it with you, focusing on:</p> <p>- Recurring themes within the list and how to address them as a tester or developer.<br/>- Particular illusions to look out for with examples from my recent past.<br/>- A guide for developers to engage with testers on unit testing, and testers with developers.\"</p> <p>Rael Sasiak-Rushby - I can write my Webscript with no alphachars<br/>\"It's about some of the crazy things about JavaScript \"under the hood\" learnt through filter evasion, explaining how I can write filly compliant and legit JavaScript that doesn't use any of the letters a-z.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no recruitment policy.<br/>Code of conduct - <a href=\"https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://leedsjs.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></p> "
