     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

  description: "Have you wondered how the creation story of Genesis fits with the evolutionary theories of popular science? You’re not alone.

They want to believe the inerrancy of Scripture, but it’s difficult to reconcile their beliefs with what science texts teach. The Unlocking the Mysteries of Genesis Conference seeks to resolve this conflict by answering key questions about the origin of human life, the age of the universe, and how scientific evidence lines up with the Bible.\nThis conference is intended for persons age 12 and up.  Younger children are welcome, but childcare will not be provided.\nSchedule\nThursday, September 13\n  6:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk  6:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   7:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk\nFriday, September 14   1:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   2:00 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk   2:30 p.m. Dinosaur Fossil Walk \n  5:00 p.m.  Registration and check-in   6:00 p.m.  Mr. Frank Sherwin  \"Scientific Evidences for Creation\"   7:10 p.m.  Break   7:30 p.m.  Dr. Tim Clarey \"Do Dinosaurs Support Evolution?\"   8:30 p.m.  Conclusion and book signing\nSaturday, September 15\n  8:30 a.m.  Dr. Jim Johnson \"Evidence Review: 5 Proofs Creation was Recent\"   9:40 a.m.  Break 10:00 a.m.  Breakout sessions 10:50 a.m.  Break 11:10 a.m.  Breakout sessions 12:00 p.m.  Lunch break* 12:20 p.m.  Lunchtime breakout sessions   1:10 p.m.  Break   1:30 p.m.  Dr. Randy Guliuzza \"Five Minutes with a Darwinist\"   2:30 p.m.  Break   2:40 p.m.  Q&A with all speakers\n*Lunch will be provided and may be eaten during the lunchtime breakout sessions\n"

    The Data Center Austin Conference (DCAC) is more akin to South by Southwest (SXSW) for the data center industry, than your average run-of-the-mill data center conference. Just as SXSW helps “creative people achieve their goals,” likewise, DCAC helps bring the most relevant thought leaders in the data center industry under one roof, in order to collaborate, innovate, and motivate.

    These individuals will discuss what they are doing to support technological developments that are changing the world. 

    By understanding the current needs, investments, and visions of the most highly advanced tech companies such as Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, others in the industry can better equip themselves for tomorrow’s demands in technology.

Our homes, schools, libraries, and governments are increasingly connected with smart devices, and our workplaces could not function without this connectivity among workers, providing sources of data and information, analytics and modeling capabilities, and storage systems.\nWith all this connectivity comes risk and threat as well as benefits: data and information have value, and things of value are stolen. Our devices and our networks must be secured against intrusion, hacking, and theft. Cybersecurity is paramount to maintaining our data security, personal security, financial security, and even national security. \nJoin us as noted threat researcher Earl Carter of Cisco Systems provides an accelerated introduction into the principles of cybersecurity, discusses the nature of common and notable hacking efforts and security breaches, and shares how you and your companies can protect yourselves in an increasingly connected world.\nWe welcome your participation! Please send us your questions, answers, and prognostications in advance at info@austinforum.org.\nAdmission to the Austin Forum is always free.\nThe Austin Forum accepts donations of used cell phones and smart phones at all our events. All devices will have a factory reset and be set up as new by the team at Austin Pathways’ nationally-recognized “Unlocking the Connection” initiative, which will connect every public housing resident with a digital device, digital literacy training, and a free or very low-cost internet connection. Your donated phone can change lives and help close Austin's digital divide, thanks to Austin Pathways.\nThanks to Austin Public Library for their partnership. \n\n\n\nAnd a special thanks to all our sponsors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n "

    Southern Research invites you to Sips & Science—an engaging evening event fusing fellowship and fun with the most fascinating scientific topics of our time. Come grow with us!




    5PM: Happy Hour

    Enjoy complimentary beer and wine while you mingle with Dr. Rita Cowell, Fellow & Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Southern Research.

    6PM: "Understanding Your Aging Brain"

    Age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and ALS are affecting more and more people, as treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes improve. Many of us know someone with an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and it is difficult to understand how a disease can influence someone's personality and ability to perform everyday tasks. Thousands of researchers dedicate their time to improve our understanding of the biological changes which cause clinical symptoms and lead to progressive changes in behavior and function. In this seminar, I will explain the changes in brain structure that accompany degeneration and discuss the strategies that scientists are exploring to prevent disease and improve brain function.  




    Dr. Rita Cowell

    Rita Cowell, Ph.D., is Fellow and Chair of the Neuroscience Department within the Drug Discovery Division. In this role, she maintains an independently-funded research program, while overseeing the Neuroscience Department with the mission of discovering novel, mechanism-based approaches to treat individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. The research in the Cowell Lab aims to determine how intrinsic transcriptional programs underlying neuronal heterogeneity give rise to selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Her research group is comprised of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees who are affiliated with Southern Research’s partner institution, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The lab is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.





    What are my parking options?

    Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability and result in a tremendous toll on society. We are assembling expert investigators to identify key issues that must be addressed in order for us to move forward from risk factors, genes, circuits, and mechanisms to effective therapies. Physicians, scientists, NIH leaders, pharmaceutical industry experts, patients, and patient advocacy groups will come together to identify new research paths and priorities for advancing promising translational research. Proceedings will be published in Science Translational Medicine. A complimentary continental breakfast will be provided both days and a complimentary boxed lunch will be provided the first day. Registration (FREE) is required due to limited seating.

In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on, and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how “Web 2.0” represented not only the resurgence of the web after the dot com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the internet as a platform. In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.
