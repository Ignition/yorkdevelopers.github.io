    Judging Criteria

    The jury looks at three different criteria: breakthrough factor, impact and performance:-is the idea original and catchy and have the potential to inspire other ideas;-the relevance and scope of impact of your work;-are the ideas explained in a clear and understandable way.

    Judging panel will consist of Research Theme Champions, invited external judges, Communications colleagues and for one of the heats our PVC-R , Debbie Smith will be judging.

    Prizes-Ist prize will be an iPAD mini and the top two entrants are then able to qualify for the York Lab final on the 23rd June 2016.

- name: The way to a lectureship
  description: >-
    What's beyond the Ph.D. ?

    Let's discuss it with our lecturers in a panel discussion, chaired by Sarah Thompson (head of department).

    Our panel members are Alessandro Pastore, Christian Diget, Laurence Wilson, Keith McKenna and Erik Wagenaars. What brought them to where they are today ? And what could be the good, the bad and the ugly reasons for a lectureship position ?

    Our ECF session will last 60min with the following structure:


    at the start, each panel member gets 3 minutes for his/her introduction. So we'll get a brief summary of how they obtained their lectureship position, but also if there where any cross-road moments or atypical/unusual steps on the road.

    Sarah will then start the discussion with a few key questions, and moderate the inputs from the audience.

    We are going to extract some concluding remarks from them at the end of the session, based on the interactions.


    Join us in understanding the track system of academic success (perhaps) a bit better. The event is open for all Ph.D. students and Postdocs.

  description: >
    Bootham Talks are a series of informal lectures and discussions covering a wide range of subjects. Each topic is presented by someone passionate about their field and has opportunity for questions and discussion afterwards.


    The talks take place on the first Wednesday of each month in term time.


    The search for life elsewhere in space is one of the great unfinished works of the Enlightenment. Recent discoveries now make it highly likely that the search will be successful within a few decades.


    This introduction to the field looks at the techniques used in the quest, and the places we are expecting to find extraterrestrial life.
