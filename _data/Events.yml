     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?



    Guelph Transit buses arrive at the University of Guelph Bus Loop every hour and half hour.

    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?



    Costumes are not required. However, we offer free face painting and wand-making at the event, as well as a "photo booth" where your child can have their turn to dress up like a wizard.

    The Data Center Austin Conference (DCAC) is more akin to South by Southwest (SXSW) for the data center industry, than your average run-of-the-mill data center conference. Just as SXSW helps “creative people achieve their goals,” likewise, DCAC helps bring the most relevant thought leaders in the data center industry under one roof, in order to collaborate, innovate, and motivate.

    These individuals will discuss what they are doing to support technological developments that are changing the world. 

    By understanding the current needs, investments, and visions of the most highly advanced tech companies such as Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, others in the industry can better equip themselves for tomorrow’s demands in technology.

    Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability and result in a tremendous toll on society. We are assembling expert investigators to identify key issues that must be addressed in order for us to move forward from risk factors, genes, circuits, and mechanisms to effective therapies. Physicians, scientists, NIH leaders, pharmaceutical industry experts, patients, and patient advocacy groups will come together to identify new research paths and priorities for advancing promising translational research. Proceedings will be published in Science Translational Medicine. A complimentary continental breakfast will be provided both days and a complimentary boxed lunch will be provided the first day. Registration (FREE) is required due to limited seating.

    Visit the WyoHackathon 2018 Website for all the details about this hackathon including rules, prizes, schedule, sponsors, and updates.

    The State of Wyoming enacted five trail-blazing blockchain bills during its 2018 legislative session that garnered international attention. The WyoHackathon 2018 provides an opportunity for the global blockchain community and the State of Wyoming to converge, thank each other, collaborate, and keep Breakin' Through.

    Wyoming has a rich history of Breakin' Through! Wyoming has a long record of being first: The first woman to vote in the US, the first female governor, the first national park, and the first LLC law. And it blazed a trail in blockchain, becoming the first elected body to recognize utility tokens as a new form of property that is neither securities nor money under Wyoming law. Wyoming offers blockchain businesses its most favorable tax, business entity, and privacy protections.

    Join 300-400 developers from all over the world in this hackathon. With the help of our sponsors, we will be able to offer an engaging workspace, workshops, and prizes as well as food, drinks, and giveaways.

    KEEP IN MIND: Once you have registered for the event via Eventbrite, YOU MUST go to https://wyominghackathon.devpost.com to register your team and submit your project for the competition.

    Southern Research invites you to Sips & Science—an engaging evening event fusing fellowship and fun with the most fascinating scientific topics of our time. Come grow with us!




    5PM: Happy Hour

    Enjoy complimentary beer and wine while you mingle with Dr. Rita Cowell, Fellow & Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Southern Research.

    6PM: "Understanding Your Aging Brain"

    Age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and ALS are affecting more and more people, as treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes improve. Many of us know someone with an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and it is difficult to understand how a disease can influence someone's personality and ability to perform everyday tasks. Thousands of researchers dedicate their time to improve our understanding of the biological changes which cause clinical symptoms and lead to progressive changes in behavior and function. In this seminar, I will explain the changes in brain structure that accompany degeneration and discuss the strategies that scientists are exploring to prevent disease and improve brain function.  




    Dr. Rita Cowell

    Rita Cowell, Ph.D., is Fellow and Chair of the Neuroscience Department within the Drug Discovery Division. In this role, she maintains an independently-funded research program, while overseeing the Neuroscience Department with the mission of discovering novel, mechanism-based approaches to treat individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. The research in the Cowell Lab aims to determine how intrinsic transcriptional programs underlying neuronal heterogeneity give rise to selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Her research group is comprised of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees who are affiliated with Southern Research’s partner institution, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The lab is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.

    Lee Harper


    I did my PhD at Oxford in statistical theories of chemical reactions. After a brief stint as a high school teacher, I became a scientific analyst (what would now be called a data scientist), doing research to build machine learning models for the medical diagnostics industry. After moving to the US, I held various data and statistics roles at a couple of digital marketing startups. After coming to Galvanize to advance my python and SQL skills, I now work as a data scientist come manager for Cerebri AI Inc, where I get to work with a great team taking an innovative approach to measuring customer success.

- name: What's Happening in the Data World + Continuous Control (and retiring DevOps)
  description: "<p>SESSION ONE: What's Happening in the Data World - Where We've Come From and Where We're Going</p> <p>For 30 years the data world didn't see any major paradigm shifts. In the last 8 years there has been a tsunami of change. This is an overview of where we've come from, the reasons for all the change, and a view of where we're going.</p> <p>Speaker: Steve Hicklin<br/>Steve is part of EE's Data Practice and focuses on Data Engineering, Data Science and Platform migrations. As well as being hands on in delivery, Steve spends a lot of time working with organisations to find ways of working effectively and simply - be that pushing the limits of using Machine Learning or looking at people and processes across an organisation to optimise the best outcomes from their Data platforms</p> <p>*****<br/>SESSION TWO: Continuous Control (and retiring DevOps)</p> <p>Many of us have spent what feels like the majority of our careers helping clients be ‘more agile’ — getting faster feedback, learning and experimenting, autonomous cross-functional teams, retiring ‘legacy’ stuff. But now there are a new breed of firms who don’t have legacy, for whom experimentation is the norm, who are staffed by people who have never worked in any waterfall-ish environment. This has bred a whole new range of challenges and opened up new possibility spaces. How do you help a new generation brought up on The Lean Startup to scale and build to last, to enjoy agility without sacrificing control, without bringing back ITIL and all the horrors of Enterprise IT management?</p> <p>Speaker: Dan Mitchell<br/>Dan’s the Equal Experts Operability Lead and spends his time between delivery and consulting helping organisations understand operability is about more than just the infrastructure automation they’ve been led to expect from “DevOps Engineers”. He loves to talk about platforms such as product, infrastructure, telemetry, deployment health, on-call practices and post-mortems.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p> <p>**Food and drink will be provided - we look forward to seeing you there!**</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p> "
