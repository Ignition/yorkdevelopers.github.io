What Google is to ‘search’ and Amazon is to ‘buy’, Hermes will be to ‘delivery’”.</p> <p>Now, almost 18 months in, I will be talking about all that we have managed to achieve in that time and the fun (lots) and pain (not too much) that we had in doing it using a heady mix of videos, powerpoint and plain old talking, with subjects including robots, digital assistants, a chicken and Google Glass.</p> <p>SPEAKERS</p> <p>Robert Walters, Full Stack Developer</p> <p>Hermes Innovation Lab</p> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</p> <p>**Food and drink will be provided - we look forward to seeing you there!**</p> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</p> '

- name: 'All Our Futures: An education fit for the world of the mid-21st century'
  description: >
    What is education really about if not building the future?


    In modern times, the pace of change has quickened with every passing generation and shows no sign of slowing down. What sort of education does this generation of young people need to help it meet the demands, opportunities and challenges of that future? 


    Guided by the provocative thoughts of real experts in the fields of AI, biotechnology, the environment, the economy, lifespan & the future of work, and societal values/morality, delegates will work together to draw up A Manifesto for an Education for All Our Futures which will be shared with policy makers and opinion formers around the country. 


    The speakers are:


    Rohit Talwar CEO Fast Future Research: international speaker and consultant; joint author of Future Reinvented – Reimagining Life, Society, and Business and Beyond Genuine Stupidity – Ensuring AI Serves Humanity


    Kresse Wesling Environmental entrepreneur and campaigner: founder of Elvis & Kresse, which turns industrial waste into innovative lifestyle products and returns 50% of profits to charities and organisations related to the waste


    Nick Gowing Journalist and presenter with BBC News 24, ITN and Channel 4 News; extensive reporting experience in diplomacy, defence and international security; currently Visiting Professor in the School of Social Science and Public Policy at Kings College, London


    Jules Evans Policy Director of Centre for the History of the Emotions, Queen Mary University, London; author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations and The Art of Losing Control


    Mike Shaw is a full-time geek, teaching non-stop at Bootham School since the 80s.  He is passionately interested in the future because that’s where he intends to spend the rest of his life.  His only regret is that he was born too late to meet Isaac Newton and too soon to visit Mars


    Hosted by:


    Chris Jeffery Headmaster of Bootham School and Bristol Rovers fan
