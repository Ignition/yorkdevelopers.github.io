    Quantum States Tour: From the garden to the pub

    Physsoc is delighted to welcome Professor Irene D'Amico from the Physics Department in York for a special talk to end this terms public lectures. Please join us as we explore how the weirdness of quantum mechanics is much closer than you'd think - please see a description from Professor D'Amico below:

    Mmmmmmmmmm…You probably thought that nothing was further away from quantum mechanics than a pub or a garden…but here they come! Quantum states are going to expand their quirkiness among flowers and pints of lager. Come listen to what would happen if familiar flowers would become quantum flowers and to marvel about the weirdness of entangled beers...And maybe learn a quantum trick or two!

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

This is an invitation-only event organised and held by Corecom Consulting, Yorkshire’s fastest growing IT recruitment specialist.</p> <p><b>WHY SHOULD I ATTEND?</b></p> <p>ITBoss creates a unique platform for Senior IT Professionals all over Yorkshire to debate, discuss hot topics, learn from reputable and established speakers whilst networking with like minded individuals in an intimate but friendly environment.</p> <p><b>FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS ITBOSS EVENTS</b></p> <p>“The ITBoss networking event was an extremely valuable event to participate in. I networked with like-minded IT Directors and Heads of IT, sharing some useful tools, practices and insights which I have transferred to the workplace. It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> '
