- name: Free Open to Everyone Evening!
  description: "<p><b>What's happening?</b></p> <p>Are you an artist, maker, hobbyist, tinkerer, engineer or someone who just likes to make things or even just discuss creativity in Leeds?</p> <p>Come along and talk to like minded people and members at Leeds Hackspace, feel free to bring along a project that you're working on or just have a chat.</p> <p><b>So is this free? Do I have to book or something?</b></p> <p>Yes, it is free. Leeds Hackspace is a work-space, community group type and workshop area. We have snacks you can buy at our own Tuck Shop, internet access via WiFi or wired Ethernet.</p> <p><b>There doesn't seem to be many attending?</b></p> <p>A lot of our members, some 30+ do not use Meetup, and they regularly attend the open evenings/days without RSVPing on here. So don't worry, the open evenings happen regularly and every week.</p> <p><b>What do you have?</b></p> <p>Wood and metal workshop, laser cutter, 3D Printer, Vinyl cutter, computers, electronics, a heat press, and all sorts of <a href=\"https://wiki.leedshackspace.org.uk/wiki/Leeds_Hackspace\">other goodies</a>. However, using a lot of these things require an induction and for you to be a paying member, but we have these open evenings so that you can look around and check the place out. Some members are happy to help you if you need to be pointed in the right direction or have something that needs repairs.</p> <p><b>So is this a business.. ?</b></p> <p>Leeds Hackspace is registered as a business, but it is run voluntarily by Directors and members, if you want to see a change you can make it happen.</p> <p><b>How do I get there?</b></p> <p>You can find out more details about visiting here: <a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\"><a href=\"http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/\" class=\"linkified\">http://leedshackspace.org.uk/getting-here/</a></a> there is limited on-site free parking, and on-street parking is free after 6pm.</p> <p><b>What if I want to ask more questions?</b></p> <p>We also have a mailing list: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-hack-space</a></p> "
