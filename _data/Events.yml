- name: How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help those living with Parkinson’s
  description: >-
    Speaker(s):  Professor Stephen Smith, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are influencing our everyday lives - finding the quickest route home, predicting what we might want to buy and even finding us the perfect partner - but can it also help those living with Parkinson’s?  Parkinson’s is a devastating condition that affects 1 in 100 of those over 60 and currently has no cure. It costs the UK over £2 billion per annum and numbers are set to rise as we all live longer.

    In this lecture we will see how evolutionary algorithms, a form of machine learning, can help diagnose and monitor Parkinson’s, assist in the prescription of medication, and find new drugs to slow or even halt this debilitating condition.

    This talk will be preceded by a drinks reception in P/T/005A in the Exhibition Centre at 5.30pm  - open to all ticketholders.

    During our TEDxYork event we will explore how memories are anchored, how we both engage with and protect ourselves from the world around us, and how technology can affect and reflect different kinds of truth.

    We will explore the realities from the perspective of others who share our world e.g. the humble bumble bee. We will also learn how we can enhance our reality using our senses in different ways e.g. in food and drink. Finally we will discover a new world of choices and consequence, explore the opportunities and threats on the horizon from our accelerating world of immersive and virtual reality, enhanced experiences and artificial intelligence.

    How does our sense of humanity fit with this brave new world and should we be excited or very very afraid!

  description: "Systems Change Thinking - Creating Value and Closing the Loop from Unavoidable Food Supply Chain Wastes\nWe are delighted to announce an opportunity to attend a free, one-day event on understanding the chemical and environmental benefits of utilising unavoidable food supply chain wastes (UFSCW). Current strategies for dealing with UFSCW are rudimentary and of low value: these include waste to energy (including incineration and anaerobic digestion), animal feed and bedding; composting; ploughing back in to soil; and, least preferably, landfill. \nIn response, this event explores UFSCW as a unique bioresource: a treasure trove of unexploited, bio-based materials and chemicals, with a range of potential commercial applications underpinned by holistic life-cycle thinking.\nThe event will be of particular interest to companies of all sizes wishing to valorise food waste streams as well as academics and policy makers. Particular benefits to attendees include:\n\n\nAn introduction to the new Sustainable Waste Valorisation Identifier (SWaVI)  tool which enables companies to identify and compare different potential valorisation strategies based on economic viability as well as sustainability and technological readiness.\n\n\nA chance to listen to key industrialists, academics and consultants discuss valorisation from not only a company, but also a more holistic supply chain perspective.\n\n\nThe opportunity to hear from leading academic and industrial speakers about the latest, novel, technical approaches to food waste valorisation.\n\n\nThe ability to interact and connect with researchers, industrialists and policy makers interested in collaborative UK and global projects.\n\n\nPoster abstract submission deadline\nThe deadline for poster abstract submission is Monday 29th October.\n\n\nDownload the abstract template form\n\n\nSubmit your completed abstract form to sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk as a word document or share as a Google Doc\n\n\nContributed poster presentations A0 format \n\n\nRegistration \nRegister your place for free by 16th November 2018.\nProgramme\nSession One: Holistic Systems Change (Chair: Professor Shahin Rahimifard, Loughborough University)\nSession Two: Change, Technology and Methodologies (Chair: Professor Timothy Foster, University of Nottingham)\nSession Three: Influencing Systems Change (Chair: Dr Avtar Matharu, University of York)\nLunch and refreshments provided.\nInvited Speakers\nHugh Powell Product Technology Centre, Nestlé\nZainudin Umar Global Food Structure & Ingredient Science, PepsiCo International\nGeoff Archer THYME Project, Teesside University\nSponsorship\nIf you would like to sponsor or exhibit at the event, please contact sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk for more details.\nWe gratefully acknowledge funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Re-SAUCE project EP/P008771/1) which has contributed to the organisation of this free event."

    Dr Lizzie Rushton, Director of Evaluation, Institute for Research in Schools and Honorary Senior Research Associate, UCL Institute of Education

    The Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS), is charity that works to enable all students, teachers and technicians to have the opportunity to become contributing and valued members of the scientific community. Formally established in March 2016, IRIS enables over 200 schools to access authentic research projects so that students, teachers and technicians can genuinely contribute to and experience the excitement and challenge of science. This is achieved by giving schools access to data, providing support and resources for teachers and technicians and lending scientific research equipment. IRIS supports projects across the range of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) disciplines. This talk will share ways in which IRIS evaluates the impact of this work on participating students and teachers. IRIS’ emerging research into the professional identities of teachers who collaborate with their students in STEM research will also be discussed, focusing on the shift some teachers appear to make from the role of science teachers to ‘teacher scientist’.

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers

In my work delivering high-performance, high-availability websites for some of the UK’s biggest retailers, I’ve come up with a wealth of ways in which we as front-end developers can improve performance without the need for any costly rewrites, new infrastructure, or any kind of work that requires permission (and budget!).</p> <p>We may not be able to make the _fastest_ website without permission, but we can certainly make a fast one!</p> <p>Jusef Belkasemi - HTML5 games with Phaser 3 (an introduction)<br/>HTML5 games are an awesome way to use your JavaScript skills to add some more interactive content to your website or to allow you to build a new mobile or desktop game. The modern device and browser capabilities give you all the power needed to jump into this exciting field. Today I would like to introduce you to Phaser this is a 2d HTML5 game development framework that I have recently started using to learn how to build HTML5 games. I hope by the end of this talk you will share my enthusiasm for this framework and start building a game of your own.<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
