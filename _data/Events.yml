It's at the brand new SRP Park in North Augusta (187 Railroad Ave., North Augusta, SC 29841), adjacent to the Savannah River. Music, food, beverages, people, things to do. We'll post updates for the afterparty as we know them!\nOrganizers\n\nLawrence Abrams | @vpnpoker\nMark Baggett | @markbaggett\nDoug Burks | @dougburks\nRon Martin\nMike McDargh | @mmcdargh\nPhil Plantamura | @philplantamura\nJoanne Sexton\n\nFAQs\nWill it cost me to bring my child or a guest to the conference and/or afterparty?\nYes. As great as our venues are, they have a finite amount of space for attendees.  \nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the conference?\nYes, please bring your ticket as it's your admission to the event and you will need it at check-in. You also can use the Eventbrite app.\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the afterparty?\nIf you attend the conference, present your bundle or separate afterparty ticket when you check in to receive a paper afterparty ticket. That paper ticket will be collected at the gate when you enter the afterparty.\nIf you purchased an afterparty ticket separately without attending the conference, please bring your Eventbrite ticket as it's your admission to the event and you will need it to enter. You also can use the Eventbrite app.\nWhat's the deal with the afterparty?\nIt's at the new SRP Park. There's no game that night. There will be batting cages, giveaways, entertainment, food, drink, stay-and-play tours, and other exciting things. The WOW Club will be open as well. \nThe name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?\nEach attendee needs to have their own ticket in their own name.\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the conference venue?\nThe most convenient way to get to the venue is by car. Parking is available in the gravel lot adjacent to the building and in the Goss Lane Parking Deck, which can be found on the map (just above the Harrison Education Commons): http://www.augusta.edu/maps/images/healthsciencescampus.pdf \nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the afterparty?\nThe most convenient way to get to the afterparty venue is by car. Parking for the afterparty will be in the garage next to the stadium and will be marked. Overflow parking will be at the North Augusta Municipal Building.\nWhat can I bring to the conference?\nBring a laptop if you plan to participate in the CTF or a workshop. \nWhat is the refund policy?\nSorry, there are no refunds.\nI bought a conference ticket and now I want to go to the afterparty. Can I get the bundle deal retroactively on my ticket?\nNo. If you think you might want to go to the afterparty, buy the bundle for $10 more. Even if you don't go, proceeds from your purchase will help us make the event even better.\nPrivacy Policy\nWe (the BSidesAugusta Board of Directors) are collecting your data only for BSidesAugusta registration/notification/capacity planning purposes. We don't give it to any sponsors, vendors, etc. We don't even give it to all our staff, just the ones who need it to check you in. The rest just get number totals.\n"

In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on, and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how “Web 2.0” represented not only the resurgence of the web after the dot com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the internet as a platform. In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

- name: "Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series: Talithia Williams"
  description: >-
    Join West Virginia Science & Research for the next installment of the Chancellor's STEM Speaker Series at our new location: the Culture Center at the state capitol complex in Charleston. Dr. Talithia Williams is a groundbreaking professor, popular TED speaker, inspiring author and passionate STEM/STEAM advocate. A host of the PBS series, NOVA Wonders, she has made it her life's work to get people of all ages and backgrounds excited about the bold possibilities of a STEM education and to “STEMpower” women and minorities to enter these professions. Her latest book, Power in Numbers: The Rebel Women of Mathematics, reflects Williams’ passion to re-brand the field of mathematics as anything but dry, technical or male-dominated. Renowned for her popular TED Talk, “Own Your Body’s Data,” she advocates for all of us to deploy data as a way of taking charge of our own health. A vibrant, engaging and energizing speaker, Dr. Williams demystifies data, statistics, probabilities and the mathematical process in amusing and insightful ways. She also passionately champions the contributions of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians and their vital role in transforming our future.

    Dr. Williams is associate dean for research and experiential learning and associate professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, where she develops statistical models which emphasize the spatial and temporal structure of data, and applies them to real world problems. Focused on data analytics, mathematics, statistical modeling and STEM Outreach, she is the first African-American woman to achieve tenure at the college. She hosts NOVA Wonders, a PBS mini-series that explores the biggest questions on the frontiers of science. The Los Angeles Times praised the show for sending the message “that scientists come in a range of ages, genders, colors and hairstyles.” She also appeared in NOVA’s Prediction by the Numbers, a series exploring the history of probabilities and gambling which Forbes called, “an entertaining, fun piece that conveys her knowledgeable and deep interest in this predictive method.” In addition to her teaching and television work, she has partnered with the World Health Organization in developing a cataract model used to predict the cataract surgical rate for countries in Africa. Her professional experiences include research appointments at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA’s Johnson Space Center, and the National Security Agency.

    An exceptional communicator and gifted teacher, Dr. Williams won the Mathematical Association of America’s Henry L. Alder Award for distinguished teaching. She also developed a 24-part college level lecture series on learning statistics for The Great Courses, an online platform for lifelong learners. Dr. Williams earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Spelman College, a master’s degree in mathematics from Howard University and a Ph.D. in statistics from Rice University.

    Described by audiences as engaging, relevant, funny, accessible, and a joy to work with, Dr. Williams captivates and inspires with her contagious enthusiasm for STEM in general and math in particular. Applying the data-driven approach made famous in her TED talk to a range of subjects, she takes sophisticated numerical concepts and makes them understandable to a wide audience, debunking perceptions with an energizing call to “show me the data!”PARKING: Culture Center visitor parking is free on evenings and weekends. You may park in the metered lots on the Capitol Complex without “feeding the meters.” On weekdays, parking in these lots is available, but you will need to bring quarters for the meters. Additional visitor parking is available at Laidley Field on Elizabeth St. BOOK SIGNING: Dr. Williams’ book will be available for purchase at the event courtesy of Taylor Books. Her signing will immediately follow the program.

After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>We have two amazing talks lined up for you this month!</p> <p>Our first speaker is Callum Whyte, a senior .NET developer for The Cogworks in London. He is currently leading the team building an app to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy for the NHS utilising some of the latest tech: Xamarin, microservices with Azure Functions and .NET Core.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>How do you scale an over engineered monolith intended for millions of users?<br/>How do you fix bugs and add new features to a codebase that's impossible to understand?<br/>How can you avoid rewriting everything yet make the application perform as it was intended?<br/>How do you do all of this while the app is LIVE and being used by many users every day?<br/>The answer: restructure it into small maintainable chunks – microservices!</p> <p>Callum will discuss the process he followed to transition an app for the NHS into a majestically constructed microservices architecture, the lessons learnt and pain points felt along the way.</p> <p>We'll take a look at the infrastructure components you can use with limited knowledge to get started using microservices, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway to build a large API.</p> <p>Finally we'll take a look into the code and have a look at the iterative changes we had to make to ensure our old monolithic app could scale, such as building a new authentication \"service\" based on IdentityServer and restructuring specific components into Azure Functions!</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tom Parrish, one of Crisp's Senior Developers. C# is constantly evolving so you can write the most advanced coding of your career. With C#8 rumoured to launch later this year, Tom will guide you through the key features and share ideas on how you can use them in 2019.</p> "

  description: "<p>An small informal event for anyone interested in the Ruby programming language. All skill levels welcome, come along with your newbie questions or tell us about your advanced Rails core contributions.</p> <p>There are sometimes one or two short 5 minutes talks at the start of each meeting. Anyone is welcome to talk about any subject that they think would be interesting to an audience of Ruby developers. See our \"Lightning talks\" page for more details:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/</a></p> <p>We were originally brought together by our interest in the Ruby programming language but many other languages get discussed (recently Go and Elixir are quite common), along with lots of other mostly, but not exclusively tech stuff.</p> <p>A bit of business networking goes on (many of us are contractors and sometimes work together) but that's not too common.</p> "
