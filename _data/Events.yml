  description: "This program will highlight the workflows and techniques to prepare models for successful transition to visualization products. Our presenters will demonstrate multiple software and their links to Revit, which include: Revit Live, Lumion and Enscape. They will provide live, \"fake\" (not real projects) models to demonstrate the real world, practical applications for visualization within Revit and Beyond!\nCome explore these different software options and obtain a better understanding of the different types, as well as the benefits of 3D visualization. Incorporating these software options into your daily workflow will help you achieve real time updates, exportable walkthroughs, easy software maneuvering, and basic graphic controls; not to mention the compatibility with Oculus rift technology. \nMake sure to reserve your seat now by registering. We hope to see you there!\n\n\n\n***Plus, details for 2017 Rendering Contest will be revealed!\n\n       Richard Carter Warfel Construction Company Director of Virtual Design & Construction      Cat Conlin Beers   Hoffman Architects BIM Manager   \n"
