- name: 'Artificial Intelligence: Promises and Perils - Focus Day'
  description: >-
    The £12m Assuring Autonomy International Programme is spearheading research, training and standards in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS). Our vision is to further enable the widespread and beneficial uptake of RAS by overcoming the obstacles to achieving regulatory and public acceptance.

    Do you know what artificial intelligence (AI) is? Would you like to find out more? Join us to discuss what we should and shouldn’t be worried about, and what AI might mean for our future health, employment and everyday life. As well as inspiring talks from experts, our Focus Day includes opportunities to chat with artificially intelligent agents.

    11am to 4.30pmExhibitionExplore AI, robotics and autonomous systems: Have a chat with a chatbot; see robots in action and have a go at programming your own; or play noughts-and-crosses against the computer and watch its ‘thought processes’.

    11am to 11.45amWhat is Artificial Intelligence?Our keynote address introduces you to the world of artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems. Find out about the robots that are already here and part of our lives, and discover what the future may hold.

    12 noon to 1.30pmDriverless VehiclesDriverless vehicles have been hitting the headlines – autonomous cars, crew-less tankers and parcel delivery by drones. They promise improved freedom and efficiency, but how do we live safely in a world of AI?

    2.30pm to 4pmArtificial Intelligence for HealthWould you choose to be looked after by a robotic carer? Could AI be used to support those with mental health issues? Is the potential for AI to revolutionise healthcare overhyped or could it transform the NHS?

    4.30pm to 6pmThe Future of WorkIn the near future, autonomous systems will be placed in roles and given functions currently performed by skilled humans. We discuss the implications for the world of work.

- name: 'Professor Martin Hendry: Ripples of Gravity, Flashes of Light'
  description: >-
    The first ever direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations, from the collision of two massive black holes more than a billion light years away, has been widely hailed as the biggest scientific breakthrough of the decade, and led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics to three senior LIGO scientists and pioneers: Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.  August 2017 then saw another spectacular discovery – as for the first time gravitational waves and light were detected from the same cosmic source: a pair of colliding neutron stars 130 million light years distant. Join LIGO scientist Professor Martin Hendry as he explores the amazing technology behind the detection of gravitational waves, and what their discovery might soon tell us about some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics and astronomy.

    Martin Hendry is Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Glasgow, where he is currently Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. He is a senior member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, for which he chairs the LSC Education and Public Outreach Group.

    The Interactive Media Showcase, as part of the annual LUMA festival at the University of York, is organised by students on the BSc in Interactive Media degree programme. It is a showcase designed to show off the sheer variety of skills and talent that the course has to offer. The event has been entirely student-led, with a group of dedicated students working over the past months to organise, promote and develop the event. The showcase will be a great opportunity not only to see what the students on the course are capable of but to meet the talent and engage in an exciting community of students.

    There will be something for everyone at the event, from Critical and User Experience Design pieces to Virtual Reality experiences and humanities dissertation pieces. All of which have been selected to show the very best of what the students are capable. All of the work being showcased will be pieces that have been submitted for previous assignments, showing the calibre and expected quality of work that the students are expected to deliver.  The evening will take place on the University’s Campus East within the Department of Theatre, Film and Television and welcomes those who are excited to see the future of media and mass communication.

- name: Impossible futures? Environmental utopias
  description: >-
    For the last 50 years environmentalism has warned of the dire consequences of abusing and exploiting the planet’s resources, conjuring future wastelands of chaos. But it has also generated rich new ideas about how humans might live better with nature. Using examples from science fiction and popular nonfiction texts, Lisa Garforth of Newcastle University explores what green hopes for the 21st century might look like.

- name: Binding Blocks Student Training Workshop 2018
  description: >
    Join the Department of Physics at the Unviversity of York for a Binding Blocks training day for nuclear physics communication: open to all physics postgraduate students from any institution and to undergraduates studying physics at the University of York.  

    This half day student workshop will focus on student training in public engagement, in particular preparing participants for practical publican engagement in nuclear physics in a way that is both research linked and matched to the nuclear physics curriculum of secondary education in the UK. This is facilitated through the construction and engagement with the 7-metre Binding Blocks nuclear chart built from LEGO-bricks, in combination with interactive workshops on nuclear astrophysics and other areas of nuclear physics, including workshops available for Nuclear Masterclasses and engaging activities when discussing nuclear physics with the public.


    The workshop programme will include:


    Engagement with a Binding Blocks Nuclear Masterclass.

    Student presentations on schools workshops.

    Overview of the UK secondary-education curricula. 

    Communicating Science and STEM-ambassador induction.



    The programme will be presented jointly between students who have engaged with the programme in the past, academics from the University of York, as well as science communicators from both University of York and the National STEM Learning Centre.

    The workshop will thereby focus on sharing and developing expertise in public engagement among PhD students and undergraduate students. The workshop will include interactive engagement with nuclear physics and will prepare participants for subsequent public engagement, for example during Nuclear Masterclasses, public events, public talks, schools engagement, or engagement in teacher training. This includes, the planned Binding Blocks programme at York and other UK universities during June-September 2018.

    Bones – imaging prehistoric and modern women

    Dr Alison Macintosh, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge

    Human bones are highly adaptable, tailoring their size and shape in response to the conditions to which they are exposed during growth and adulthood. Because of this adaptability during life, human skeletal remains can provide a wealth of information about the living conditions and behaviour patterns of men and women in the past. However, interpreting that information can be challenging, and we don’t yet have a good understanding of how women’s bones in particular reflect developmental and behavioural factors. This talk outlines the ways in which we are using cutting-edge imaging technologies and the study of living athletes to better understand variation in women’s bone strength, as well as body size, muscle, and fat, and what this new information means for more richly reconstructing prehistoric women’s lives from skeletal remains. 

    This research was funded by the European Research Council, grant agreement n.617627′ and an ERC Starting Grant (ERC-2010-StG263441). The event is hosted by Yorkshire Philosophical Society.

  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more!

Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

- name: 'OR Society Online Resource Training: Maths is Fundamental'
  description: >-
    Want to encourage school pupils to engage with maths but not sure how? 

    Maths skills are vital in the field of operational research (OR), where techniques such as problem structuring methods and mathematical modelling are used to analyse complex business situations.

    The OR Society has developed a series of workshops for school groups aged 11-16 years to support maths learning in the classroom. The workshops engage pupils in fun activities that are directly connected to the National Curriculum, building analytical skills and showcasing careers in which these skills are essential. 

    If you are a STEM Ambassador or a member of the OR Society, please join us for a free training session provided by the OR Society and learn how to deliver two popular maths workshops:

    Playing with LEGO

    This session uses LEGO to engage students by building tables and chairs and get them thinking about the different ways and number of combinations available, given a limited number of bricks. This then leads them to develop the most efficient way to build table and chairs if squares and rectangles cost different amounts, and chairs and tables sell for different amounts. The material uses algebra, formulating equations, solving and graphing inequalities, addition and subtraction.

    Playing Snakes and Ladders - Climbing the Career Ladder  

    The aim of this pack is to introduce students to one of the topics of O.R. in a fun and engaging way. It uses a specially designed board game to engage students by moving around the board and exploring the different careers and opportunities available to maths students. Perhaps you become a mathematical comedian and move forwards 4 spaces, or perhaps you buy the wrong plane for BA and move back 2 spaces! This then leads onto how a board game is designed, flow charts and the algorithms behind it. 

    Please register in advance if you wish to attend this training session. Refreshments will be provided to keep you going!


    Find out more here  about how OR Society volunteers offer education outreach to schools.

    Workshop Six: Writing Workshop and Picnic at the T2/Pollination Project Allotment

    As we postponed the Terra Two session at the allotment in May, the June workshop will integrate the plan for that session with the original plan for June:

    In this workshop we will think about the theme of beginning in ‘the middle’, based on the concept advanced by Deleuze and reflecting on what it might mean to settle on Mars or another planetary body, and we will read extracts from science fictional green futures/solar punk to seed our thinking. We will each do some weeding, and then we will plant and water in some new plants (plants provided). We will then individually take a lawn chair off to a corner of the larger allotment site, perhaps under a tree, in order to write or sketch a response to these experiences. Finally we will gather together on the grass near the football pitch over snacks and drinks to discuss our responses, potentially sharing a plan for an article, poem, short story, visual artefact, or other form of writing for a summer submission to Terra Two. This workshop will be delivered by Liesl King and Abi Curtis.

    Optional - come dressed as your favourite science fictional character! Food and drinks provided; alternative venue for writing session planned in case of rain.

    Note: the Haxby Road allotments are on Haxby Road, across the street from and slightly past the York St John Sports Centre.  Look out for balloons tied around the sign to mark the entrance.

- name: Kafka at the BBC & Kafka ops at Sky B&G
  description: "<p>Join us for the 2nd Leeds Apache Kafka meetup on May 29th from 6:00pm hosted by Sky Betting and Gaming in Leeds. The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm: Doors open<br/>6:30pm - 7:00pm: Pizza &amp; Drinks &amp; Chat<br/>7:00pm - 7:45pm: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka - David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming<br/>7:45pm - 8:30pm: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure - Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>8:30 pm - 9:00pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka<br/>- Speaker: David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming.<br/>- Abstract: How Platform Services have gone from supporting 4 Kafka Clusters in 2017, to creating 9 Clusters so far in 2018. Scaling the amount of Clusters to met the demand of SBG and how it's become an integral part of the company's future.<br/>- Bio: David joined SBG in 2016, after background in aerospace engineering. After exploring a range of roles in devops, across SBG, David joined Platform Services where for the last year he has supported Kafka as a service. Kafka is now a key component in the running of real time services for both the Betting and Gaming tribes. David has interests in statistics, analytics and asking the question why? Outside of work he is a passionate sports fan and dog lover.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure<br/>- Speaker: Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>- Abstract: In the beginning was PIPs, an API backed by a relational database used to store all the BBC's programme metadata. But as more clients came, with more requirements and ever more complex queries, the system became unwieldy to develop and use. The Programme Metadata team turned to a combination of a Kafka platform and Clojure microservices running in AWS to produce multiple pipelines, one per client requirement. This setup turns the normal ETL pipeline on its head, with one consistent backend and multiple differing outputs. This talk will show some common patterns used by the team, how they use the microservice approach to quickly spin up new client pipelines, and how the structure of Clojure mirrors and supports the way they use Kafka.<br/>- Bio: Dan graduated in 2004 and spent 10 years working as a Network Engineer. In 2014, realising that the bits of the job he enjoyed the most all involved coding, he changed tack to become a Software Engineer for the BBC in Manchester, UK. He is now a Senior Software Engineer in the Programme Metadata team, delivering scalable and reliable APIs used as part of the backend to the BBC's programme distribution through iPlayer, /programmes, schedule EPGs, and third parties like Sky and Virgin's on-demand services or the American \"BritBox\" streaming platform. He has the world's best Labrador.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>The full address for the venue is:</p> <p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>3rd Floor<br/>6 Wellington Place<br/>Leeds<br/>LS1 4AP</p> <p>For people who have visited the Sky Betting &amp; Gaming offices previously, this is our new building.</p> <p>There is wheelchair access.

However, this usually means that we also have an app for each device taking up space on our phones, no matter how infrequently we use it. Wouldn’t it be great if we could just use the web?</p> <p>With Web Bluetooth, we can control these devices through the browser! In this talk we’ll take a look at the basics of Web Bluetooth, the Bluetooth Low Energy GATT layer and how to use these through JavaScript using the practical example of how I built an interactive LED pixel display. By the end, I hope you’ll be inspired to try controlling your Bluetooth devices through the browser!\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: 'All Our Futures: An education fit for the world of the mid-21st century'
  description: >
    What is education really about if not building the future?


    In modern times, the pace of change has quickened with every passing generation and shows no sign of slowing down. What sort of education does this generation of young people need to help it meet the demands, opportunities and challenges of that future? 


    Guided by the provocative thoughts of real experts in the fields of AI, biotechnology, the environment, the economy, lifespan & the future of work, and societal values/morality, delegates will work together to draw up A Manifesto for an Education for All Our Futures which will be shared with policy makers and opinion formers around the country. 


    The speakers are:


    Rohit Talwar CEO Fast Future Research: international speaker and consultant; joint author of Future Reinvented – Reimagining Life, Society, and Business and Beyond Genuine Stupidity – Ensuring AI Serves Humanity


    Kresse Wesling Environmental entrepreneur and campaigner: founder of Elvis & Kresse, which turns industrial waste into innovative lifestyle products and returns 50% of profits to charities and organisations related to the waste


    Nick Gowing Journalist and presenter with BBC News 24, ITN and Channel 4 News; extensive reporting experience in diplomacy, defence and international security; currently Visiting Professor in the School of Social Science and Public Policy at Kings College, London


    Jules Evans Policy Director of Centre for the History of the Emotions, Queen Mary University, London; author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations and The Art of Losing Control


    Mike Shaw is a full-time geek, teaching non-stop at Bootham School since the 80s.  He is passionately interested in the future because that’s where he intends to spend the rest of his life.  His only regret is that he was born too late to meet Isaac Newton and too soon to visit Mars


    Hosted by:
