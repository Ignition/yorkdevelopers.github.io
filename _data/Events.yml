    --- Joint University of York GCRF IAA Meeting and Departmental Seminar ---


     Stopping the Punjab choking Delhi

    In December 2015, Delhi was named as the ‘most polluted city in world’ surpassing Beijing. The uncontrolled burning of agricultural residues post-harvest in the Punjab (North India) is often cited as a significant factor as the particulate matter (smog) is transported south due to prevailing winds. Pollution in Delhi is so extreme it may have damaged the lung function of half the city’s 4.4 million children so severely that they will never fully recover. The purpose of this meeting is to explore the potential development of rural biorefineries in North India using advances in biotechnology, green chemistry and environmental sensing that offers a viable alternatives to burning of agricultural residues.

    This half day workshop shows how businesses large and small can benefit from using cloud-based backups in Microsoft Azure.

    Whether looking to protect your IaaS assets in Azure or other datacentre providers, or simply looking for a way to backup critical on-premises systems to the cloud, we will explore why this feature is highly popular. We will also examine how ASR can be used to bring servers online into a Disaster Recovery (DR) datacentre or how to use Azure as your DR site.

  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p><br/>We're excited about March's event! First up we have Mike Monteith (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeMonteithDev\">@MikeMonteithDev</a>) discussing an idea he's had for static sites and going CMS-less for non-developers. It's an interesting idea and we're eager to hear what Mike has to say!</p> <p>Next up we have Ian Thomas (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/anatomic\">@anatomic</a>) who will be talking about giving a talk titled \"Patterns For React Application Design\". Here's a bit from Ian:</p> <p><i>\"Working with React can be equal parts enlightening and bewildering where the community agreed standards change frequently and ideas evolve at a rapid pace. Having worked with React for three years this talk is an attempt to distill some of the core principles and patterns I have used to build scalable, performant applications.</i></p> <p><i>As a firm believer in Test Driven Development, you'd think we'd start by looking at how to effectively unit test React applications, but this isn't the case! Instead, we'll discuss how to introduce React into a codebase before moving on to state management, managing responsibilities in components, lifecycle methods and asynchronous data dependencies.</i></p> <p><i>Finally, we'll wrap up by comparing Observables to Redux, some patterns for testing apps (see it snuck in there somewhere) and a few obscure tips, tricks and areas to watch in the future.\"</i></p> <p>Sounds like it'll be a great talk and we're really looking forward to it!</p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: 'Bootham Talks presents: The Search for Extra-terrestrial Life'
  description: >
    Bootham Talks are a series of informal lectures and discussions covering a wide range of subjects. Each topic is presented by someone passionate about their field and has opportunity for questions and discussion afterwards.


    The talks take place on the first Wednesday of each month in term time.


    The search for life elsewhere in space is one of the great unfinished works of the Enlightenment. Recent discoveries now make it highly likely that the search will be successful within a few decades.


    This introduction to the field looks at the techniques used in the quest, and the places we are expecting to find extraterrestrial life.
