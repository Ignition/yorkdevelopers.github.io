Not just scepticism but downright cynicism. As a software tester, a large part of my role is to be a skeptic but sometimes this crosses over to cynicism. Identifying risks in code, architecture and products is helpful, dismissing ideas is not, especially as this behaviour can rapidly spread. What if the team becomes cynical? How can we break out of the cycle and actually start building software?</p> <p>It’s very common for a team to pick up a piece of software and look at what has been written and decide, it’s simply trash. People believe that it can be built better. That the tools that the seemingly legacy software was built in have been superseded and the product is no longer fit for purpose. Cynicism for what is deemed as legacy but optimism for the brave new world.</p> <p>Gwen will look at cynicism, scepticism, optimism and more as attitudes to building products, legacy and green field. She will identify some attitudes that help build, strong, long lasting products. If cynicism isn’t cool anymore, then what is?</p> <p>Gwen Diagram:</p> <p>Gwen Diagram is a technology professional from Leeds who specialises in testing. She is an avid automation evangelist with a focus on testing complemented by repeatable build processes with monitoring. She has had varied roles throughout her career including Scrum Master at a Start Up and DevOps kid at a large Financial Services organisation. She is the Lead Product Tester at Monzo, a challenger bank focusing on building a product with known quality, fast.</p> <p>As a strong believer in making the tech industry as open and punk as possible, she co-organises a twice yearly free day long testing conference called the Leeds Testing Atelier. She speaks regularly at local meet-up groups, Agile Yorkshire and Leeds DevOps, duels with creative types at events like the Tech Off, speaks internationally at conferences such as Nordic Testing Days in Tallinn and was the closing keynote at Agile on the Beach in Falmouth, UK in 2018.</p> <p>Outside of work, you will usually find her hanging around a Natural History Museum somewhere in the world marvelling at how incredibly excellent dinosaurs are, feeding pigeons or ducks or researching the latest thing she has decided she is obsessed with.</p> <p>Talk: Autistic Accessibility (Matthew Parker)</p> <p>Description: Accessibility Testing is often looked at from the perspective of physical disabilities like vision impairment, motor skills etc. Whilst there is some overlap, considering accessibility for Autistic people requires thought and understanding of the challenges. It’s not a perfect science but is important if you genuinely want an inclusive product. This is an introduction to understanding and including consideration for Autistic Accessibility in your Accessibility approach.</p> <p>Matthew is a senior tester and coach currently in a contract at Bet365. Alongside our own Ady Stokes, he recently co-hosted a Ministry of Testing Power Hour on the Club.</p> <p>A dynamic tester, consultant and coach with over 17 years software experience, 15 of which spent working in testing roles including management he is dedicated to being an accessibility advocate and his focus on making a difference to the Autistic Community is inspired by his Autistic son.</p> "

He will augment this with Logic Apps to power a Xamarin Forms app. The app itself has some new features from the latest 4.0 release, including the new CollectionView.</p> <p>Visual Studio App Center allows developers to ship better apps through a suit of functions including automated builds, testing, crash and analytics reporting as well as push notifications. I’ll quickly cover these existing features before moving onto to showing two new preview features released earlier this year; authentication and data.</p> <p>The addition of Authentication and Data to App Center takes it from a DevOps tool to a fully fledge Mobile Backend as a Service! This session has been created to help you understand you can get started with the new features in the context of Xamarin.Forms. I’ll also show how you can extend the functionality through Azure Logic Apps to create a global scale backend with zero lines of code.</p> <p>As experts, I’d love to hear your feedback as we look to add new features and functionality to App Center</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:30 Pizza, drinks &amp; chat<br/>19:00 Leeds Sharp introduction and industry news<br/>19:15 Kaizen Bits<br/>19:30 Design Pattern Recognition<br/>19:45 Break<br/>20:00 Main talk - Build global scale mobile apps with C#<br/>21:00 The Brewery Tap for drinks and chats</p> '

Maybe you'll try a new IDE, unit testing (or not), a new style of coding, even a new language!*</p> <p>As usual bring a laptop if you have one with your favorite development environment(s) set up. If you don't have one that's fine, there will be plenty between us.</p> <p>The night is suitable for any level of experience, but you'll need to know some programming if you want to get properly involved.</p> <p>There will be pizza from 6pm, and we're aiming for an early start so try and be here by 6:15pm.</p> <p>* Unfortunately we can't guarantee you partner will agree with where to put the curly braces. &gt;:-/ We'll have security on hand in case any serious arguments break out..</p> <p>Hope to see you then!</p> "

- name: Angular & Typescript For .NET Developers by Martin Randall
  description: "<p>Angular is a Typescript-based open-source web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google that grew out of its predecessor, AngularJS. It is constantly being built upon and improved with a non-breaking, major release cadence of around 6 months.</p> <p>The presentation will be a quick tour around the Angular platform, using it to build a small sample application, along with a demonstration of some of the features of Typescript.</p> <p>Martin Randall -<br/>I've been a C# .Net developer for over 17 years, and I've found Angular to be a natural choice for a .Net developer over alternative application platforms such as React because it forms a framework that offers many features 'out-of-the-box' such as routing, a web API client library, form validation, and a powerful CLI tool for quickly scaffolding new applications and components. The MVC pattern used by the Component architecture will be very familiar to Asp.Net developers and Typescript brings a welcome addition to those that found Javascript frustrating in the past.</p> <p>I've been a developer for over 25 years, working in a variety of industries. I've spent the last 12 years as a freelance contract developer that has given me experience of working within many different teams on a wide range of projects. I've used Angular on a number of projects over the last 4 years.</p> "

The answer is a feature rich, graphical, scalable data flow environment to rival any ETL tech we’ve previously had available in Azure. In this session we’ll look at Azure Data Factory and how it integrates with Azure Databricks to produce a powerful abstraction over the Apache Spark analytics ecosystem. Both through mapping transformations and wrangling capabilities. These new features mean we can now transform our data in Azure with scale out processing using Databricks and also without the need to write a single line of Scala or Python! SSIS developers – you’re going to love this. For new comers, if you haven’t used either service yet, don’t worry, you’ll get a quick introduction to both before we go deeper into the new data factory data flow features.</p> <p>Paul is a Microsoft Data Platform MVP with 10+ years’ experience working with the complete on premises SQL Server stack in a variety of roles and industries.
