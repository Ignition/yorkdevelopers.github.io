     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?

    ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS FOUNDATION

    Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 17.5 million deaths each year. Cardiovascular disease may strike those in their prime years and, due to population aging, also afflict elderly people who are otherwise living healthy lives. Improvements in cardiovascular therapy have markedly reduced procedural risk, and thereby enabled the treatment of a broad range of patients, more than ever before in the history of medicine. Nonetheless, significant disparities in the delivery of cardiovascular care continue to exist, leading to large unmet clinical needs for many patients worldwide. Innovation in the delivery of cardiovascular care, as well as education of the public at-large, is essential for optimizing the management of these patients.


    The Cardiovascular Innovations Foundation is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    The mission of the Foundation is to address unmet needs in cardiovascular care through the study, design, and development of innovative health care solutions and education of health care providers and the larger public.

  description: >2+


    TeacherCon is a free multi-day experience for Canadian educators in the K-12 school system, as well as student teachers and teacher leaders who want to inspire kids to be builders – not just consumers - of technology through coding activities and challenges. TeacherCon will provide how-to guides, hands-on training, lesson-planning tools, mentor support and access to an educator community for sustainable support and collaboration.Takeaways from TeacherCon will include Teacher Guides, access to an online lesson-planning platform, community support for afterward.We’ve combined our experiences teaching thousands of youth across the country to code, our tips and tricks to get started, resources to familiarize yourself with code, plus lots of easy to follow and even easier to implement coding activities to empower and teach the future generation of technologists across Canada.Let's shape how technology education is introduced in schools across the country - together!Agenda:


    Introduction to the “why’s” of Coding

    Exemplars of Coding Projects and Lesson Plans

    UnPlugged Coding Activities (no computer required)

    Coding and Debugging in Scratch

    HTML and CSS coding for web pages

    Tech Stations featuring other tools

    Processing language for beginners

    Little Robot Friends microprocessor robotics


    Take-Aways:


    Teacher Guides and Lesson Plans

    Software and web-based tools

    Access to Teachers Learning Code Community Support for educators

    Cool Canada Learning Code Swag

    Little Robot Friend (your own mini-robot) 


    Why Teach Code?Technology is everywhere and it’s not going anywhere. Teaching kids to code is about more than just helping children understand the technology they are using and secure employment in the future. At a fundamental level it improves problem-solving and thinking skills.We think it’s important for youth to learn to code for a few reasons:


    Coding is a superpower. Learning to code let’s kids build -- not just consume the technology around them like video games, websites, robots and more.

    Coding helps kids develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that gives kids a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships or jobs - they are valuable skills that are in high demand.

    Coding helps kids understand the world around them better. If we teach biology and mathematics in order to understand the world around them, then knowing the basics of how computers communicate - and how to engage with them -should be a given.

    Coding can help change the world empower kids to use technology as a creative tool to build solutions for problems or challenges people face everyday.

    Coding is fun! We want kids to experience the satisfaction and thrill of building something of their very own.



    Conference Dates:

    This conference will run over the course of three days; Tuesday, August 7th from 9:30am - 4:30pm, Wednesday, August 8th from 9:30am - 4:30pm, and Thursday, August 9th from 9:30am - 4:30pm. Breakfast will be served beginning at 9:00, Workshop begins at 9:30 AM. 


    Who is this for?

    Our TeacherCon experience has been designed for educators (primary, middle and high) with little to no coding experience to be able to teach coding fundamentals to their students.


    Prerequisites:

    None! This experience is designed for absolute beginners!

- name: APIs on the Scale of Decades with Gary Fleming
  description: "<p>\"APIs are hard. They are pretty much ship now, regret later.\" -- Chet Haase.</p> <p>What do Greek philosophy, early video games, and Japanese bullet trains tell us about how we should design our APIs?</p> <p>Writing any old API is easy. Writing an API that can evolve to meet your needs over the coming months, years, and even decades; now that's hard. We'll look at some common practices and try to see where they go wrong, some misunderstood techniques and how to use them better, and some less common practices that might be useful.</p> <p>Let me give you some good advice that'll help you evolve your APIs, and some big ideas that might provoke some interesting thoughts.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Gary is an agile provocateur, software nomad, and lean mercenary. His main hobby is to try and help companies to build better software in better ways. Sometimes this is by helping them with the messy human communication side of agile, and sometimes it's through teaching better software crafting practices - but it's usually at least some of each. Coaching, mentoring, writing, and showing; whatever helps in the context. You'll find him at various local meetups trying to both share what he knows and learn from his peers.</p> "
