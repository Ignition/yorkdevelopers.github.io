     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?



    Guelph Transit buses arrive at the University of Guelph Bus Loop every hour and half hour.



    If you are planning on driving to this event, please see the UoG Parking facilities information here. Parking is FREE on weekends in all lots on campus.

    What if I don't give photo permission?



    Let's Talk Science requests your permission to take photos for the use of promotion and fundraising for future events. We do not publish names of anyone in the photographs, but we may post them on our social media platforms. In addition, this is a public event so media such as local newspaper photographers and video crew may be on site, so we cannot guarantee that you or your child will not be photographed. Once you select a FREE ticket, you will be required to acknowledge photo permission for this event. If you are concerned about photography, please contact us directly at projects.LTSguelph@gmail.com and we will try to address your concerns. 



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year! The photo permission is attached to the ticket process so we avoid paperwork and signatures at the door on a chilly November morning. 



    If I make a donation now, can I get tickets early? 



    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?



    Costumes are not required. However, we offer free face painting and wand-making at the event, as well as a "photo booth" where your child can have their turn to dress up like a wizard. 



    Do we sign up for individual classes?



    This event runs mostly as a large "Station Rotation". Some events are scheduled, such as our "Magical Lecture Series", so please refer to your Marauder's Map on the day-of for details.

In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on, and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how “Web 2.0” represented not only the resurgence of the web after the dot com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the internet as a platform. In 2009, with his “Gov 2.0 Summit,” he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the Federal, State, and local level, and around the world.He has now turned his attention to implications of AI, the on-demand economy, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>We have two amazing talks lined up for you this month!</p> <p>Our first speaker is Callum Whyte, a senior .NET developer for The Cogworks in London. He is currently leading the team building an app to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy for the NHS utilising some of the latest tech: Xamarin, microservices with Azure Functions and .NET Core.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>How do you scale an over engineered monolith intended for millions of users?<br/>How do you fix bugs and add new features to a codebase that's impossible to understand?<br/>How can you avoid rewriting everything yet make the application perform as it was intended?<br/>How do you do all of this while the app is LIVE and being used by many users every day?<br/>The answer: restructure it into small maintainable chunks – microservices!</p> <p>Callum will discuss the process he followed to transition an app for the NHS into a majestically constructed microservices architecture, the lessons learnt and pain points felt along the way.</p> <p>We'll take a look at the infrastructure components you can use with limited knowledge to get started using microservices, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway to build a large API.</p> <p>Finally we'll take a look into the code and have a look at the iterative changes we had to make to ensure our old monolithic app could scale, such as building a new authentication \"service\" based on IdentityServer and restructuring specific components into Azure Functions!</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tom Parrish, one of Crisp's Senior Developers. C# is constantly evolving so you can write the most advanced coding of your career. With C#8 rumoured to launch later this year, Tom will guide you through the key features and share ideas on how you can use them in 2019.</p> "

  description: "<p>An small informal event for anyone interested in the Ruby programming language. All skill levels welcome, come along with your newbie questions or tell us about your advanced Rails core contributions.</p> <p>There are sometimes one or two short 5 minutes talks at the start of each meeting. Anyone is welcome to talk about any subject that they think would be interesting to an audience of Ruby developers. See our \"Lightning talks\" page for more details:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/LeedsRubyThing/pages/Lightning_talks/</a></p> <p>We were originally brought together by our interest in the Ruby programming language but many other languages get discussed (recently Go and Elixir are quite common), along with lots of other mostly, but not exclusively tech stuff.</p> <p>A bit of business networking goes on (many of us are contractors and sometimes work together) but that's not too common.</p> "
