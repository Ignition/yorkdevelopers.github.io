- name: 'Artificial Intelligence: Promises and Perils - Focus Day'
  description: >-
    The £12m Assuring Autonomy International Programme is spearheading research, training and standards in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS). Our vision is to further enable the widespread and beneficial uptake of RAS by overcoming the obstacles to achieving regulatory and public acceptance.

    Do you know what artificial intelligence (AI) is? Would you like to find out more? Join us to discuss what we should and shouldn’t be worried about, and what AI might mean for our future health, employment and everyday life. As well as inspiring talks from experts, our Focus Day includes opportunities to chat with artificially intelligent agents.

    11am to 4.30pmExhibitionExplore AI, robotics and autonomous systems: Have a chat with a chatbot; see robots in action and have a go at programming your own; or play noughts-and-crosses against the computer and watch its ‘thought processes’.

    11am to 11.45amWhat is Artificial Intelligence?Our keynote address introduces you to the world of artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems. Find out about the robots that are already here and part of our lives, and discover what the future may hold.

    12 noon to 1.30pmDriverless VehiclesDriverless vehicles have been hitting the headlines – autonomous cars, crew-less tankers and parcel delivery by drones. They promise improved freedom and efficiency, but how do we live safely in a world of AI?

    2.30pm to 4pmArtificial Intelligence for HealthWould you choose to be looked after by a robotic carer? Could AI be used to support those with mental health issues? Is the potential for AI to revolutionise healthcare overhyped or could it transform the NHS?

    4.30pm to 6pmThe Future of WorkIn the near future, autonomous systems will be placed in roles and given functions currently performed by skilled humans. We discuss the implications for the world of work.

- name: 'Professor Martin Hendry: Ripples of Gravity, Flashes of Light'
  description: >-
    The first ever direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations, from the collision of two massive black holes more than a billion light years away, has been widely hailed as the biggest scientific breakthrough of the decade, and led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics to three senior LIGO scientists and pioneers: Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.  August 2017 then saw another spectacular discovery – as for the first time gravitational waves and light were detected from the same cosmic source: a pair of colliding neutron stars 130 million light years distant. Join LIGO scientist Professor Martin Hendry as he explores the amazing technology behind the detection of gravitational waves, and what their discovery might soon tell us about some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics and astronomy.

    Martin Hendry is Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Glasgow, where he is currently Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. He is a senior member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, for which he chairs the LSC Education and Public Outreach Group.

- name: 'OR Society Online Resource Training: Maths is Fundamental'
  description: >-
    Want to encourage school pupils to engage with maths but not sure how? 

    Maths skills are vital in the field of operational research (OR), where techniques such as problem structuring methods and mathematical modelling are used to analyse complex business situations.

    The OR Society has developed a series of workshops for school groups aged 11-16 years to support maths learning in the classroom. The workshops engage pupils in fun activities that are directly connected to the National Curriculum, building analytical skills and showcasing careers in which these skills are essential. 

    If you are a STEM Ambassador or a member of the OR Society, please join us for a free training session provided by the OR Society and learn how to deliver two popular maths workshops:

    Playing with LEGO

    This session uses LEGO to engage students by building tables and chairs and get them thinking about the different ways and number of combinations available, given a limited number of bricks. This then leads them to develop the most efficient way to build table and chairs if squares and rectangles cost different amounts, and chairs and tables sell for different amounts. The material uses algebra, formulating equations, solving and graphing inequalities, addition and subtraction.

    Playing Snakes and Ladders - Climbing the Career Ladder  

    The aim of this pack is to introduce students to one of the topics of O.R. in a fun and engaging way. It uses a specially designed board game to engage students by moving around the board and exploring the different careers and opportunities available to maths students. Perhaps you become a mathematical comedian and move forwards 4 spaces, or perhaps you buy the wrong plane for BA and move back 2 spaces! This then leads onto how a board game is designed, flow charts and the algorithms behind it. 

    Please register in advance if you wish to attend this training session. Refreshments will be provided to keep you going!

    Workshop Six: Writing Workshop and Picnic at the T2/Pollination Project Allotment

    As we postponed the Terra Two session at the allotment in May, the June workshop will integrate the plan for that session with the original plan for June:

    In this workshop we will think about the theme of beginning in ‘the middle’, based on the concept advanced by Deleuze and reflecting on what it might mean to settle on Mars or another planetary body, and we will read extracts from science fictional green futures/solar punk to seed our thinking. We will each do some weeding, and then we will plant and water in some new plants (plants provided). We will then individually take a lawn chair off to a corner of the larger allotment site, perhaps under a tree, in order to write or sketch a response to these experiences. Finally we will gather together on the grass near the football pitch over snacks and drinks to discuss our responses, potentially sharing a plan for an article, poem, short story, visual artefact, or other form of writing for a summer submission to Terra Two. This workshop will be delivered by Liesl King and Abi Curtis.

    Optional - come dressed as your favourite science fictional character! Food and drinks provided; alternative venue for writing session planned in case of rain.

    Note: the Haxby Road allotments are on Haxby Road, across the street from and slightly past the York St John Sports Centre.  Look out for balloons tied around the sign to mark the entrance.



    NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to.

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers

  description: "<p>Join us for a celebration of agileYork's 1st birthday! (There will be cake ;)</p> <p>12 months have passed and we've discovered so much along the way. Join us to learn just how a meetup called agileYork was formed using Agile! A number of past attendees have asked how they could start a meetup group and this evening will describe just that.</p> <p>From a very simple idea you'll discover how we as a group tested assumptions, experimented with formats and collectively built a meetup through feedback.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6pm: welcome &amp; arrivals<br/>6:30pm: welcome &amp; arrival<br/>6:45 pm: eat, drink, chat &amp; celebrate<br/>7.00pm: Creating an Agile meetup using Agile<br/>8.00pm: Change the Language, Change the Rules<br/>9:00pm: to the bar/pub?</p> <p>Change the Language, Change the Rules</p> <p>The language we use influences the way we see the world, how we work<br/>together and what we believe is possible. Want to find out how the<br/>structure of language, neuroscience and a bit of pseudoscience can<br/>help build a high-performing agile team? Then drop by for a case study<br/>on how to use Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) in agile teams, with<br/>real world examples, hints, tips and tricks.</p> <p>About Tom Hoyland</p> <p>With a career spanning software engineering, business analysis and<br/>digital transformation, Tom coaches a wide range of teams, weaving<br/>together agile values, language and psychological safety to build high<br/>performing, sustainable teams.</p> <p>A host at Agile Sheffield and a regular speaker at<br/>agile and product meetups, Tom enjoys presenting case studies,<br/>research and insights into successful agile transformations, team<br/>working and their metrics.</p> <p>Oh did I mention there will be cake ;)</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group! You can earn SEUs by attending our events. ***</p> "

We'll see how PHP fits into this front end ecosystem and how to augment our applications with real time components.</p> <p>✩ From bare metal boxes to Amazon ECS, our journey to the cloud<br/>Mark Taylor</p> <p>My talk will tell the story of how DealTrak moved from over a decade of bare metal hosting to AWS with practically zero downtime, and the technologies we opted for.
