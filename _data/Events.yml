     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.

    Want to make $5k in one day, legally?

    Code/Design to Win is exactly what it sounds like, two completely different competitions with two ginormous grand prizes and several less substantial (but significant) cash rewards. If you’re a student who loves computer science, programming or product design and attends one of the many participating schools, this is a challenge for you. We’ll take care of all the details, just bring your skills and we'll pay the billz.

    How does one register?

    First, you’ll have to write the preliminary challenge (don’t worry, you got this). Find your school in the list below to register. The top students will be invited to the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Region on January 18-19, 2019 to participate in the finals, meet with some really great companies and have their shot at taking home $5,000!

- name: 'Fourth Annual Data Center Austin Conference '
  description: >2+




    The Data Center Austin Conference (DCAC) is more akin to South by Southwest (SXSW) for the data center industry, than your average run-of-the-mill data center conference. Just as SXSW helps “creative people achieve their goals,” likewise, DCAC helps bring the most relevant thought leaders in the data center industry under one roof, in order to collaborate, innovate, and motivate.

    These individuals will discuss what they are doing to support technological developments that are changing the world. 

    By understanding the current needs, investments, and visions of the most highly advanced tech companies such as Uber, Microsoft, and Facebook, others in the industry can better equip themselves for tomorrow’s demands in technology.

Our homes, schools, libraries, and governments are increasingly connected with smart devices, and our workplaces could not function without this connectivity among workers, providing sources of data and information, analytics and modeling capabilities, and storage systems.\nWith all this connectivity comes risk and threat as well as benefits: data and information have value, and things of value are stolen. Our devices and our networks must be secured against intrusion, hacking, and theft. Cybersecurity is paramount to maintaining our data security, personal security, financial security, and even national security. \nJoin us as noted threat researcher Earl Carter of Cisco Systems provides an accelerated introduction into the principles of cybersecurity, discusses the nature of common and notable hacking efforts and security breaches, and shares how you and your companies can protect yourselves in an increasingly connected world.\nWe welcome your participation! Please send us your questions, answers, and prognostications in advance at info@austinforum.org.\nAdmission to the Austin Forum is always free.\nThe Austin Forum accepts donations of used cell phones and smart phones at all our events. All devices will have a factory reset and be set up as new by the team at Austin Pathways’ nationally-recognized “Unlocking the Connection” initiative, which will connect every public housing resident with a digital device, digital literacy training, and a free or very low-cost internet connection. Your donated phone can change lives and help close Austin's digital divide, thanks to Austin Pathways.\nThanks to Austin Public Library for their partnership. \n\n\n\nAnd a special thanks to all our sponsors!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n "

    Visit the WyoHackathon 2018 Website for all the details about this hackathon including rules, prizes, schedule, sponsors, and updates.

    The State of Wyoming enacted five trail-blazing blockchain bills during its 2018 legislative session that garnered international attention. The WyoHackathon 2018 provides an opportunity for the global blockchain community and the State of Wyoming to converge, thank each other, collaborate, and keep Breakin' Through.

    Wyoming has a rich history of Breakin' Through! Wyoming has a long record of being first: The first woman to vote in the US, the first female governor, the first national park, and the first LLC law. And it blazed a trail in blockchain, becoming the first elected body to recognize utility tokens as a new form of property that is neither securities nor money under Wyoming law. Wyoming offers blockchain businesses its most favorable tax, business entity, and privacy protections.

    Join 300-400 developers from all over the world in this hackathon. With the help of our sponsors, we will be able to offer an engaging workspace, workshops, and prizes as well as food, drinks, and giveaways.

    KEEP IN MIND: Once you have registered for the event via Eventbrite, YOU MUST go to https://wyominghackathon.devpost.com to register your team and submit your project for the competition.

    5PM: Happy Hour

    Enjoy complimentary beer and wine while you mingle with Dr. Rita Cowell, Fellow & Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Southern Research.

    6PM: "Understanding Your Aging Brain"

    Age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, and ALS are affecting more and more people, as treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes improve. Many of us know someone with an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and it is difficult to understand how a disease can influence someone's personality and ability to perform everyday tasks. Thousands of researchers dedicate their time to improve our understanding of the biological changes which cause clinical symptoms and lead to progressive changes in behavior and function. In this seminar, I will explain the changes in brain structure that accompany degeneration and discuss the strategies that scientists are exploring to prevent disease and improve brain function.  




    Dr. Rita Cowell

    Rita Cowell, Ph.D., is Fellow and Chair of the Neuroscience Department within the Drug Discovery Division. In this role, she maintains an independently-funded research program, while overseeing the Neuroscience Department with the mission of discovering novel, mechanism-based approaches to treat individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. The research in the Cowell Lab aims to determine how intrinsic transcriptional programs underlying neuronal heterogeneity give rise to selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Her research group is comprised of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees who are affiliated with Southern Research’s partner institution, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The lab is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.

    Did someone say $100,000? Yeah, we did.

    Twenty-one companies led by women participated in the Fierce Founders Bootcamp.  They got a crash course in customer validation, product development, creating financials, building sales funnels and project management, but we didn’t stop there.

    They received hands-on mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and experts as they built out their business models and worked toward refining their product offerings.

    It's time to put all that training to the test, and put them in the spotlight. 

    Join us on September 6 to cheer on the top eight companies as they compete for a $100,000 grand prize in the final pitch competition.

    How's that for fierce?
