    York Science Conference 2019

    Our first annual flagship conference provides students with a platform to discover new developments in science and technology from an academic and corporate perspective. The day will include keynote speeches, panel debates, and networking opportunities. Held at the Ron Cooke Hub, this location is an impressive, large scale venue at the heart of the University of York.This event will be attended by students and industry representatives from across the UK. As of January 2019 confirmed speakers and workshops include pioneers from organisations such as Complexiti, NHS, QinetiQ, Illuminate Technologies, YHROCU and the National Spectrum Centre. Areas to be explored include gene therapy, scientific policy making, future applications of technology (5G, for instance) and semi-conductors. The underlying theme this year is ‘What will you discover?’. Our conference is open to the general public but is primarily marketed at students across the North of England. We pride ourselves on being the first student-run science-based conference in Europe giving us a first-mover advantage.

    Notably, we're excited to be partnered with Supporting Women in Science (SWIS) and will be hosting a riveting and relevant panel discussion 'Women in Stem - Challenges & Opportunities', designed to break through to the key points of view and move the conversation forwards. 

    To conclude the event, we will be hosting a networking drinks evening to which all delegates will be welcomed warmly, to discuss key insights from the day, forge long-lasting connections and enjoy good company. 



    FAQ:



    Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?

    We ask that all delegates, VIPs, corporate partners and speakers have some form of recognised ID (academic/government/industry passes will suffice), to ensure that we know who is attending, in line with our Data Policy. As there will be a drinks evening with alcohol, we will be expecting guests who are fortunate enough to look under 21 to provide proof-of-age where requested.

     

    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?

    For those arriving by train, taxis are familiar with the venue (Ron Cooke Hub, Heslington East Campus). Buses regularly go to and from campus and the York Train Station. Parking is widely available around the venue, those with accessibility requirements please contact info@yorkscienceconference.com to enable us to suppport you. VIP parking will be on offer, subject to request.

     

    What can I bring into the event?

    The event has numerous networking opportunities, so it's important to present yourself well. We aren't rigidly enforcing any dress codes, though we anticipate most will attend in business casual attire, anticipating a day of exciting opportunities that may involve moving throughout our venue spaces. Smart, comfortable clothing is a good objective.

    Within our delegate pack, we will aim to include writing materials and provide access to refreshments throughout the day. You may like to bring a small bag with lunch depending on whether you're having lunch provided by the York Science Conference. 

    In short - all we'd like delegates to bring is a sense of curiosity and excitement for what you might Discover. We ask that large amounts of baggage not be brought for H&S reasons, as well as the impact on how practical it would be for you.

     

    How can I contact the organizer with any questions?

    We have a wide range of approaches: 

    Email: info@yorkscienceconference.com --> For all queries, including those of a personal/sensitive nature

    Twitter: twitter.com/YorkSciCon --> For any questions that you're happy to have in the public domain

    Coffee has become an export of global significance for countries in East Africa, reaching diverse markets across the world, and with large numbers of farmers involved in its production. There are enormous potential benefits from the growing coffee industry but significant environmental, economic and social challenges are emerging.

- name: Global pollution in urban environments
  description: "During this lunchtime seminar, researchers at the University of York will discuss their research into global pollution in urban environments. Confirmed speakers include Dr. Harry Vallack from the Stockholm Environment Institute and Dr. Adam Vaughan from the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL).\nDr. Harry Vallack, Senior Research Asoociate for Stockholm Environment Institute in York (SEI-Y)\nHarry Vallack is an ecologist specialising in air pollutant emissions inventories, carbon dynamics of plant/soil systems, ambient dust pollution monitoring and issues relating to persistent organic pollutants (POPs).\nHarry has over 25 years experience working on various aspects of air pollution at scales ranging from local to global. This has included capacity building within non-OECD countries (including developing of suitable manuals/software) for the preparation of air pollutant emissions inventories, producing air pollution emission scenario projections for developing country regions.\nHarry’s current research interests concern short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), global change ecology, soil carbon dynamics and capacity building for emissions inventory preparation in developing countries. In the process of this research, he has developed software tools to enable developing countries to compile air pollutant emission inventories. More recently he has helped develop a tool to assist countries prioritise alternative SLCP mitigation strategies, going from emissions estimates through to likely impacts on human health crop production and climate.\nDr. Adam Vaughan, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL)\nAdam is a postdoctoral researcher at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) since 2017, specialising in urban emission measurements. WACL is the UK’s first dedicated laboratory building for atmospheric chemistry research. Adam obtained his Master’s in Chemistry from the University of Hull in 2013, and his PhD in Chemistry from the University of York in 2017, working with Prof. James Lee and Prof. Lucy Carpenter. His PhD focused on assessing UK emissions from a low flying aircraft. His work led to the first direct assessment of Greater London emissions from an aircraft through eddy-covariance, highlighting that London’s NOx emissions were being underestimated in the National Inventory. Since completing his PhD, Adam has developed a range of techniques for assessing urban emissions through enhanced eddy-covariance methodologies. He has made air quality measurements on multiple global field campaigns and more recently led research in New Delhi measuring vehicle emissions through remote sensing techniques.\nHealth in Urban Environments Event Series\nThe event forms part of the Health in Urban Environments Series where the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Interdisciplinary Global Development Centre (IGDC), Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories (WACL) and several Research Champions are joining forces to host an event series to explore Urban Living-related research and innovation at the University of York.\nThrough a series of workshops, lunchtime seminar, full day events and discussion sessions, we will gain insight into the historical development of the world’s cities and the social and environmental consequences of urbanisation.\nBy bringing together the social, physical and life sciences we will be able to explore this topic from many angles and celebrate the interdisciplinary nature of research at the University of York.\nThe series, which will begin in January and conclude in June in alignment with Clean Air Day, will be open to researchers, staff and students at the University of York. \nEvents in the series:\nExploring transport in an African city context: 12:00-14:00, 22nd January 2019\nGlobal pollution in urban environments: 12:00-13:30, 27th March 2019\nTransforming urban infrastructure: the role of religion and communities in urbanisation in Africa: 12:00-13:30, 11th April 2019\nMental health in urban environments: 9:30-12:30, 2nd May 2019\nClean Air Day- air pollution and York: 9:00-17:00, 13th June 2019"

    New Approaches for Prioritisation and Assessment of the Risks of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment

    Over the past 4.5 years, the IMI, a public-private partnership between the European Commission and EFPIA, has funded the iPiE project to develop frameworks that utilize information from toxicological studies, pharmacological mode of action and computational tools to support intelligence-based environmental testing of pharmaceuticals in drug development and to prioritise legacy pharmaceuticals (those authorized prior to the 2006 enactment of Medicines Agency requirements) for targeted environmental risk assessment and/or environmental (bio) monitoring. This two-day international conference, which marks the completion of the iPiE project, will act as a forum to disseminate the results of the project while also providing opportunity to others working on the prioritisation and intelligent assessment of pharmaceuticals, to present their work.

    Keynote LecturesProfessor Bryan Brooks, Distinguished Professor and Director Environmental Health Science Program, Baylor University, USA - ‘Future Horizons for Pharmaceutical Bioaccumulation and Effects Research in Aquatic Systems’

    Dr Kathrin Fenner, Group Leader, Department Environmental Chemistry, EAWAG, Switzerland - ‘Microbial biotransformation of contaminants: The role of bioavailability and community traits’

  description: "<p>**As the meetup is full and the waitlist function causes us so much hassle, we've closed RSVPs, they will be re opened on Sunday 17th for any last minute free places, please check back if you didn't get a space**</p> <p>Time for our second meetup of 2019 at The ODI Node in Leeds on Monday 18th February 2019:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : The Case Against Microservices<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Habitat<br/>9:00 - late : Social</p> <p>Our first speaker of the evening is Aled Sage who is VP Engineering at Cloudsoft and co-founder of Apache Brooklyn. He spends his time helping customers migrate, run and evolve their applications in AWS; and developing the backend automation and processes to do this efficiently and reliably. He also helps big enterprise with devops and automation, particularly for disaster recovery and cloud-native. Aled has 20 years experience developing and managing distributed applications, mostly in the enterprise sector. Particular areas of interest include cloud, automation, devops, docker, fault tolerance and concurrency.</p> <p>His talk is about the case against microservices as he believes there are not enough talks out there about the downsides of microservices. Lots of people talk about how to do microservices right, some about the pitfalls and failures that we can learn from. But are microservices even the answer to your biggest painpoints, or will they inevitably increase the pain for you? This presentation covers why many companies should not even try to do microservices: highlighting simpler ways to get the \"benefits of microservices\", the downsides of microservices, and the risks they introduce. Finally, it covers the scenarios in which microservices are a good fit.</p> <p>We are delighted to have Adrian Daniels who is a Field Solutions Architect at Chef Software. Adrian says he thrives on helping people to use and understand technology so that they can be more efficient and produce higher quality software.</p> <p>Adrian will be talking about Habitat, an open-source project by Chef that enables you to ship your application, to any platform, along with all the automation you'll need to manage it in production. In this talk, he'll look at creating the habitat plan, building packages, exporting to common container platforms, and running the habitat packages in their own process management supervisor. You'll learn the steps to create repeatable, portable application environments for your applications from a clean room environment to running them in production. There will be plenty of examples of how its been used by customers.</p> <p>Refreshments</p> <p>As it's the start of a new year we've decided to expand the range of refreshments we offer, there will now be a wider range of quality soft drinks, teas and coffees - a massive thanks to our sponsors Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for their continued support and sponsorship.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

Except it isn't. Code gives us the power to unleash our creative potential in new and interesting ways, whether that’s making interactive art, creating live music and visualisations, building games or even adding joyful flourishes on a web app.</p> <p>In this talk, I’ll show that our code doesn’t just have to be for building boring applications. Using real examples, I’ll talk about some ways that we can bring creativity into our coding projects, as well as ways for us to share our knowledge and why it’s important that we do. By the end, I hope to have inspired you to bring creativity into your projects and given you the enthusiasm to share your knowledge.</p> <p>Wade Penistone (@PenistoneWade) - Mindstack<br/>Bots, machine learning and AI are hot topics in the industry at the moment. The skillsets are in demand and there is plenty of resources for learning. Lots of people now also use voice assistants and helpdesk automated facilities.</p> <p>However developing for these is still a very vague and improvised strategy, with tools and frameworks only offering a limited scope and most of us as web developers unaware on the layers of compexity involved in creating an effective AI.</p> <p>Join me for what I believe is a solution to this problem, aimed at simplifying and consolidating the code needed in an nice and easy to use package/ecosystem.</p> <p>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

  description: "<p>Providing decent monitoring of your applications has always been considered the boring part of development, with tons of boilerplate code, and making upfront decisions around how it will be done, or retrofit afterwards. However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it's never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production.</p> <p>In this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other.</p> <p>We’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate.</p> <p>We’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information. Finally, we'll look at Honeycomb.io and how they're providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production.</p> <p>Martin Thwaites<br/>VP Engineering @ MAG-O</p> <p>Martin is the VP of Engineering @ MAG-O, the Online arm of Manchester Airport Group.

- name: 'Refugee Week: Public lecture by Gulwali Passarlay'
  description: >
    Gulwali is a dedicated advocate and spokesperson for refugees and asylum seekers across the U.K and is the Co-Founder of not-for-profit organisation “My Bright Kite CIC”. 


    Since arriving in the UK in 2007 after being forced to leave Afghanistan as a 12 year old boy, Gulwali has achieved beyond all odds to become a well-respected and sought after public speaker, influencer and political campaigner for refugee’s rights, social justice and education. The experience of his journey to the UK shaped his future and inspired an insatiable determination and commitment to raise awareness and make a difference for other refugees. 


    Among his many achievements, Gulwali graduated with a Politics degree from The University of Manchester and he is now studying for his MPA at Coventry. Gulwali is the esteemed author of his autobiography, "The Lightless Sky: My Journey to Safety as a Child Refugee". 


    In his talks, Gulwali shares his captivating story of struggle, danger and resilience and how he miraculously survived the harrowing year long journey from Afghanistan to the UK, on his own, after being separated from his brother. Through his talks, audience’s young and old, are able to achieve an understanding of the extent of adversity that refugees face and thus be inspired to instigate positive change in their environments.
