To master the hacking technologies, you will need to become one, but an ethical one! The accredited course provides the advanced hacking tools and techniques used by hackers and information security professionals alike to break into an organization. As we put it, “To beat a hacker, you need to think like a hacker”. This course will immerse you into the Hacker Mindset so that you will be able to defend against future attacks. The security mindset in any organization must not be limited to the silos of a certain vendor, technologies or pieces of equipment.\nThis ethical hacking course puts you in the driver’s seat of a hands-on environment with a systematic process. Here, you will be exposed to an entirely different way of achieving optimal information security posture in their organization; by hacking it! You will scan, test, hack and secure your own systems. You will be taught the five phases of ethical hacking and taught how you can approach your target and succeed at breaking in every time! The five phases include Reconnaissance, Gaining Access, Enumeration, Maintaining Access, and covering your tracks!\n \nTarget Audience\nThis course will significantly benefit security officers, auditors, security professionals, site administrators, and anyone who is concerned about the integrity of the network infrastructure.\n \n Prerequisites\nThe knowledge and skills that a learner must have before attending this course is as follows:\n\nHave successfully completed EC-Council’s Certified Network Defender (CND) course or\nHave successfully completed CompTIA’s Security+ (IN-SE) course\n\nThere is a minimum age requirement that applies and attendance of the Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures training course or attempts at the relevant exam, is restricted to candidates who are at least 18 years old.\n \nWhy Certified Ethical Hacker Training from Omni212 ?\n\nOur CEH training is very hands on.

Testing is one of those areas that people often skip or forget about and it's great to have Colin join us to talk about it and it's importance</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Colin:</p> <p><i>\"Testing is important - it can improve the quality of your code and give you the reassurance to refactor without fear of destroying your application.</i></p> <p><i>My talk will cover different types of automated testing  in javascript (unit, integration, acceptance) and some regression as well tools to help standardise code (like js lint).</i></p> <p><i>I'll also talk about automated build tools like jenkins and travis ci.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we've got Lorna Mitchell (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lornajane\">@lornajane</a>) with a talk titled \"Fun with serverless Javascript\". Serverless is one of the areas of development which is growing and I'm really looking forward to hearing more about it!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Lorna:</p> <p><i>\"Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for JavaScripters of all levels.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
