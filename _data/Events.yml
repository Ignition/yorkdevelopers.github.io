To master the hacking technologies, you will need to become one, but an ethical one! The accredited course provides the advanced hacking tools and techniques used by hackers and information security professionals alike to break into an organization. As we put it, “To beat a hacker, you need to think like a hacker”. This course will immerse you into the Hacker Mindset so that you will be able to defend against future attacks. The security mindset in any organization must not be limited to the silos of a certain vendor, technologies or pieces of equipment.\nThis ethical hacking course puts you in the driver’s seat of a hands-on environment with a systematic process. Here, you will be exposed to an entirely different way of achieving optimal information security posture in their organization; by hacking it! You will scan, test, hack and secure your own systems. You will be taught the five phases of ethical hacking and taught how you can approach your target and succeed at breaking in every time! The five phases include Reconnaissance, Gaining Access, Enumeration, Maintaining Access, and covering your tracks!\n \nTarget Audience\nThis course will significantly benefit security officers, auditors, security professionals, site administrators, and anyone who is concerned about the integrity of the network infrastructure.\n \n Prerequisites\nThe knowledge and skills that a learner must have before attending this course is as follows:\n\nHave successfully completed EC-Council’s Certified Network Defender (CND) course or\nHave successfully completed CompTIA’s Security+ (IN-SE) course\n\nThere is a minimum age requirement that applies and attendance of the Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures training course or attempts at the relevant exam, is restricted to candidates who are at least 18 years old.\n \nWhy Certified Ethical Hacker Training from Omni212 ?\n\nOur CEH training is very hands on.
