  description: >-
    While many believe that free will is vital for human dignity, morality and responsibility, others claim it is an illusion. But what exactly is free will? Do we have the kind of free will which gives us enough control over our own lives for our choices to make a difference? What about notions of blame and responsibility? Join philosopher Julian Baggini and psychologists Christian Jarrett and Adrian Raine to find out more.

- name: Understanding York’s environment
  description: >-
    Speakers: Ruth Davis - E3G, Professor Mike Depledge - University of Exeter and Professor Alistair Boxall – Environment Department


    Research in Focus

    This event will be followed by a free drinks reception, a photo exhibition and an interactive installation in the Hub's 3Sixty space. 

    About half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and ongoing migration into cities has given rise to larger, ultimately, mega-cities. Latest figures show that by 2050, 66% of the world’s population will be urban - equivalent to around 6.3 billion people. If not managed adequately, urbanization can adversely affect the health and wellbeing of human beings and lead to social and environmental injustice. It has long been recognised that that the quality and distribution of the natural environment within cities (e.g. amounts of blue and green space, levels of pollution and the degree of biodiversity) affects the health, wellbeing and equity amongst city populations. However, the relationship between these different endpoints is still relatively poorly understood. With improved understandings of these relationships, it may be possible to better manage natural environments within cities providing multiple benefits to the whole community.

    New technologies, such as wireless sensing networks, wearable devices, drones, crowdsourcing, 3D models of cities and virtual reality used together could provide the environmental, health and social data we need to understand the relationships between the quality of natural systems and linkage to health, wellbeing and equity of city populations at very high temporal and spatial resolutions. The York City Environment Observatory (YCEO) project, which is jointly led by the City of York Council and the University of York, aims to design and lay the groundwork for establishing a unique city observatory for determining the links between environment quality issues in York in order to better understand how these issues affect health, well-being and the economy of the city. The YCEO will look to the past, present and future in trying to diagnose and predict environmental issues for York and their associated human health and well-being and economic impacts.

    This series of three keynote lectures, given by leading experts from environment and health, will explore the importance of place and nature, how the environment affects our health and wellbeing, and finally, how novel projects, such as the York City Environment Observatory, seek to understand and quantify these relationships.

    Speaker biographies: 

    Ruth Davis is a writer, campaigner, political analyst and conservationist with over twenty years’ experience in the environment sector. 

    Her areas of interest include the relationship between environmental politics, social justice and the wider politics of the common good; the importance of place and a love of nature in determining identity and fostering well-being; and how these forces interact with different models of economic development and democratic participation, to shape future land-use planning, housing and infrastructure choices.

    She took her first degree in English at Oxford before studying at Kew Gardens and Reading University, where she obtained an MSc in Plant Sciences. Between 1997 and 2001 she managed an extensive programme of conservation projects for Plantlife – the Wild Plant Conservation Charity - before joining the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, where she lead the Society’s work on water and climate change. From 2009 to 2015 she was Political Director at Greenpeace UK, where she helped develop and implement campaigns on climate and energy, fair and sustainable fishing and the protection of the Arctic. Ruth writes extensively about the philosophy, politics and practice of environmentalism, and was awarded an MBE for services to the environment in 2014.

    Mike Depledge has given hundreds of lectures at international conferences, workshops, universities and research institutes over the past 30 years, to a wide range of audiences. He has recently led establishment of the European Centre for Environment and Human Health on the University of Exeter Medical School campus in Truro.

    Professor Depledge is interested in all aspects of biology, but especially the ways in which anthropogenic activities affect the environment and human health. The ecotoxicological research he conducted has focused on the effects of environmental pollutants on the physiology and behaviour of marine invertebrates and subsequent ecological and evolutionary consequences. He has a particular interest in biomarkers that allow changes in the health and physiological status of organisms to be monitored over time.

    Alistair Boxall is Professor in Environmental Science.  Alistair’s research focuses on understanding emerging and future ecological and health risks posed by chemical contaminants in the natural environment. Alistair is a member of the Defra Advisory Hazardous Substances Advisory Committee and is Chair of the Pharmaceutical Advisory Group of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. He regularly advises national and international organisations on issues relating to chemical impacts on the environment and has published extensively on the topic of emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and veterinary medicines) in the environment. Alistair is co-ordinator of the 3.5 M Euro project 'CAPACITIE' which is exploring methods for monitoring pollution in cities.

    You’ve probably heard of a little thing called the universe. And you probably know about physics, the stuff that explains how the universe works...

    but what you might not know is just how much we actually don’t know !!

    We are so pleased to welcome the most entertaining experts at explaining (un)known things, here, at York: PhD Comics’ Dr Jorge Cham and physicist Prof Daniel Whiteson !!

    In their new book, "We Have No Idea," Jorge and Dan explore why a vast portion of our universe is still a mystery, and what a lot of smart people are doing to understand it. And to mark the release of their hilarious and helpful guide to the Unknown Universe, we want to have this quirky, vibrant and engaging discussion by a cartoonist and a physicist, here, at York.



    This fun event is really perfect for anyone who’s curious about all the great mysteries physicists dream to solve next !!

    While many talks explain what we know about the universe, this one tackles all the weird stuff we haven’t figured out yet. Let's explore some of the biggest holes in our cosmic knowledge:



    why does the universe have a speed limit?

    what (or who) is attacking earth with tiny, super-fast particles?

    what exactly is Dark Matter?

    and for that matter…what is matter?



    This interactive and extremely entertaining lecture will along the way demystify complicated things such as quarks, neutrinos, gravitational waves and exploding black holes -- enjoy !!



    "A delightful combination of comedy and cosmology that is as charming as it is informative," Zach Weinersmith (creator of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)



    Btw, our visitors will be signing books after the fun lecture, which will be available for purchase that day. Of course, if you don’t want to wait, you can already get the book at all major retailers.



    All about the most entertaining researchers on this planet:



    Jorge is the creator of "PhD Comics", the hugely popular ongoing internet and print comic strip about life (or the lack thereof) in Academia.

- name: The Voices in All Our Heads
  description: >-
    Psychologist and award-winning writer, Charles Fernyhough tells a story of things in our minds. He explores the inner voice and dialogue in all our heads, and how this may help us understand how and why some people hear voices.

    Charles’ talk is a story of the things that we think. As you read this, you might recognise an internal voice that talks you though what is written. It’s quite normal and it doesn’t upset you. It might also be there when you remind yourself what you need to do, and what you think about things.

    Many psychologists think that those who hear voices have lost the ability to connect themselves with this voice so they think it doesn’t belong to them. This can become distressing.

    In order to understand voice hearing, we therefore need to understand more deeply how we talk to ourselves – our internal dialogue - in terms of why we do it and how it works.

    Charles will review some of the recent findings on voice hearing and inner speech and explore the implications of these. He will discuss this in relation to the contrast between how common this inner speech is, but how hearing voices is seen as atypical. He will also talk about why it can be valuable to understand some forms of voice hearing as inner speech, as well as how this interacts with memory.

    About the speaker

    Dr Charles Fernyhough is a psychologist and award-winning writer. He is Chair in Psychology at Durham University, having gained a first degree in Natural Sciences, followed by a PhD in Developmental Psychology from Queens’ College, Cambridge. Charles is a Chartered Psychologist and Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society.

    In addition to numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals, Charles has also written a selection of fiction and popular non-fiction books. His awards include a Time to Write Award from the Northern Writers’ Awards and an Arts Council of England Grant for the Arts.

    He has taught creative writing, with a particular focus on psychological processes in reading and writing, in a variety of contexts around the UK, including a short course on Creative Writing and Psychology at Newcastle University.

- name: Astrocampus Star Party - Late Night Observing
  description: >-
    As we move further into spring, the nights are becoming shorter and shorter. As a result, there's less opportunities available for astronomy. So wrap up warm and join us at the University of York's Astrocampus on 26th May as we stay up late to learn all about the night sky and (weather permitting) explore it in great deal with our telescopes!

    The main intention of this event will be to make good use of the observatories and telescopes that we have available here at the University of York. The night before will be a new moon, meaning the skies will be as dark as possible for us to hopefully observe some deep sky objects. This would include star clusters, nebulae and other galaxies! If the skies are clear, then there's plenty for us to look up at in the fast approaching summer sky. At the very least though, the planet Jupiter will be shining brightly in the sky, and when peered at through a telescope it'd be hard to miss its four Galilean moons!

    However, clear skies unfortunately aren't a guarantee. So over the course of the event, there will be a range of different talks delivered as well. Topics include:



    Looking at the basics of astronomy, and learning how you can best get involved with the hobby yourself at home



    The history of telescopes, telling the 400 year long story from Galileo's handy refracting telescope, to the James Webb Space Telescope being launched by NASA next year



    A lesson in cosmology, looking at the hidden parts of our universe that we simply cannot see or detect yet makes up most of the universe

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

  description: "<p>Hey there Javascripters!</p> <p>May is upon us and we've got a couple of great talks lined up for you!</p> <p>First up we have Colin Oakley (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/htmlandbacon\">@htmlandbacon</a>) with a talk titled \"Testing most things in JavaScript\". Testing is one of those areas that people often skip or forget about and it's great to have Colin join us to talk about it and it's importance</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Colin:</p> <p><i>\"Testing is important - it can improve the quality of your code and give you the reassurance to refactor without fear of destroying your application.</i></p> <p><i>My talk will cover different types of automated testing  in javascript (unit, integration, acceptance) and some regression as well tools to help standardise code (like js lint).</i></p> <p><i>I'll also talk about automated build tools like jenkins and travis ci.\"</i></p> <p>Next up we've got Lorna Mitchell (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lornajane\">@lornajane</a>) with a talk titled \"Fun with serverless Javascript\". Serverless is one of the areas of development which is growing and I'm really looking forward to hearing more about it!</p> <p>Here is a brief intro from Lorna:</p> <p><i>\"Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for JavaScripters of all levels.\"</i></p> <p>The talks start at around 7:00, but most people show up from 6:45 for pizza and to network and chat about all things JavaScript before the talk. After the talk we’ll be heading over to Headrow House to have a drink and to chat some more.</p> <p>The door to get in is shown here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY\" class=\"linkified\">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEs_alSgXLU9mlLSGXSFeewOjmQLpOuz6eyr80eP2iyaIDQrxDXo92ZdGieYhauCC0pEm1OscRbGdC3lNbWSRgakHCSv1AxFGEBwV6VFqkw3U2KCjb1IO1t6ftdVDUYB35QNAwPY</a></p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
