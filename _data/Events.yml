  description: >-
    The £12m Assuring Autonomy International Programme is spearheading research, training and standards in the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS). Our vision is to further enable the widespread and beneficial uptake of RAS by overcoming the obstacles to achieving regulatory and public acceptance.

    Do you know what artificial intelligence (AI) is? Would you like to find out more? Join us to discuss what we should and shouldn’t be worried about, and what AI might mean for our future health, employment and everyday life. As well as inspiring talks from experts, our Focus Day includes opportunities to chat with artificially intelligent agents.

    11am to 4.30pmExhibitionExplore AI, robotics and autonomous systems: Have a chat with a chatbot; see robots in action and have a go at programming your own; or play noughts-and-crosses against the computer and watch its ‘thought processes’.

    11am to 11.45amWhat is Artificial Intelligence?Our keynote address introduces you to the world of artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems. Find out about the robots that are already here and part of our lives, and discover what the future may hold.

    12 noon to 1.30pmDriverless VehiclesDriverless vehicles have been hitting the headlines – autonomous cars, crew-less tankers and parcel delivery by drones. They promise improved freedom and efficiency, but how do we live safely in a world of AI?

    2.30pm to 4pmArtificial Intelligence for HealthWould you choose to be looked after by a robotic carer? Could AI be used to support those with mental health issues? Is the potential for AI to revolutionise healthcare overhyped or could it transform the NHS?

    4.30pm to 6pmThe Future of WorkIn the near future, autonomous systems will be placed in roles and given functions currently performed by skilled humans. We discuss the implications for the world of work.

- name: 'Professor Martin Hendry: Ripples of Gravity, Flashes of Light'
  description: >-
    The first ever direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations, from the collision of two massive black holes more than a billion light years away, has been widely hailed as the biggest scientific breakthrough of the decade, and led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics to three senior LIGO scientists and pioneers: Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.  August 2017 then saw another spectacular discovery – as for the first time gravitational waves and light were detected from the same cosmic source: a pair of colliding neutron stars 130 million light years distant. Join LIGO scientist Professor Martin Hendry as he explores the amazing technology behind the detection of gravitational waves, and what their discovery might soon tell us about some of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics and astronomy.

    Martin Hendry is Professor of Gravitational Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Glasgow, where he is currently Head of the School of Physics and Astronomy. He is a senior member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, for which he chairs the LSC Education and Public Outreach Group.

    Five ideas in chemical education that must die

    Professor Eric Scerri

    Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry UCLA Los Angeles

    www.ericscerri.com

    The title was inspired by a recent book entitled, This Idea Must Die, in which 175 leading thinkers expound on ideas, theories and concepts which they believe to be unproductive and which in their view should be retired (Brockman, 2015). Quite remarkably, there is not a single chemist among the assembled cast of authors, thus further reinforcing the common misconception that chemistry lacks any philosophical substance or profound intellectual content.  

    As somebody who has spent a career in attempting to promote the philosophical aspects of chemistry and the value of taking a more reflective view in chemical education, I feel compelled to make up for the deficit in the cited book.  I will discuss what I consider to be five obstructive and confused ideas that continue to exist among chemical educators and authors of chemistry textbooks.  These are five ideas in chemistry that should die.   


    The notion that the 4s atomic orbitals are preferentially occupied and also preferentially ionized in transition metal atoms.

    A solution with a pH of 7 it is neutral and vice versa 

    Le Châtelier’s Principle. 

    Chromium displays an anomalous configuration because of half-filled subshell stability.

    The view that group 3 of the periodic table consists of Sc, Y, La and Ac.

    Eric Scerri received all his degrees in the UK before going to the US in 1995 as a Caltech postdoctoral fellow.  For the past eighteen years he has been a lecturer at UCLA where he teaches general chemistry as well as courses in History and Philosophy of Science.  He is also the founding editor of the journal Foundations of Chemistryand the author of several books with Oxford University Press including 

    The Periodic Table, Its Story and Its Significance(2007), 

    A Very Short Introduction to the Periodic Table (2011)

    Want to encourage school pupils to engage with maths but not sure how? 

    Maths skills are vital in the field of operational research (OR), where techniques such as problem structuring methods and mathematical modelling are used to analyse complex business situations.

    The OR Society has developed a series of workshops for school groups aged 11-16 years to support maths learning in the classroom. The workshops engage pupils in fun activities that are directly connected to the National Curriculum, building analytical skills and showcasing careers in which these skills are essential. 

    If you are a STEM Ambassador or a member of the OR Society, please join us for a free training session provided by the OR Society and learn how to deliver two popular maths workshops:

    Playing with LEGO

    This session uses LEGO to engage students by building tables and chairs and get them thinking about the different ways and number of combinations available, given a limited number of bricks. This then leads them to develop the most efficient way to build table and chairs if squares and rectangles cost different amounts, and chairs and tables sell for different amounts. The material uses algebra, formulating equations, solving and graphing inequalities, addition and subtraction.

    Playing Snakes and Ladders - Climbing the Career Ladder  

    The aim of this pack is to introduce students to one of the topics of O.R. in a fun and engaging way. It uses a specially designed board game to engage students by moving around the board and exploring the different careers and opportunities available to maths students. Perhaps you become a mathematical comedian and move forwards 4 spaces, or perhaps you buy the wrong plane for BA and move back 2 spaces! This then leads onto how a board game is designed, flow charts and the algorithms behind it. 

    Please register in advance if you wish to attend this training session. Refreshments will be provided to keep you going!

    Workshop Six: Writing Workshop and Picnic at the T2/Pollination Project Allotment

    As we postponed the Terra Two session at the allotment in May, the June workshop will integrate the plan for that session with the original plan for June:

    In this workshop we will think about the theme of beginning in ‘the middle’, based on the concept advanced by Deleuze and reflecting on what it might mean to settle on Mars or another planetary body, and we will read extracts from science fictional green futures/solar punk to seed our thinking. We will each do some weeding, and then we will plant and water in some new plants (plants provided). We will then individually take a lawn chair off to a corner of the larger allotment site, perhaps under a tree, in order to write or sketch a response to these experiences. Finally we will gather together on the grass near the football pitch over snacks and drinks to discuss our responses, potentially sharing a plan for an article, poem, short story, visual artefact, or other form of writing for a summer submission to Terra Two. This workshop will be delivered by Liesl King and Abi Curtis.

    Optional - come dressed as your favourite science fictional character! Food and drinks provided; alternative venue for writing session planned in case of rain.

    Note: the Haxby Road allotments are on Haxby Road, across the street from and slightly past the York St John Sports Centre.  Look out for balloons tied around the sign to mark the entrance.



    NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to.

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers

- name: Sustainability Metrics
  description: "SUSTAINABILITY METRICS\nTracking, Measuring and Reporting Responsible Innovation\nAim of the Workshop\nMeasure and monitor your supply chain’s performance with appropriate and easy-to-use sustainability metrics. Existing industrial sustainability metrics primarily focus on the chemical process, although awareness of the need to consider the ‘bigger picture’ and incorporate both upstream and downstream of the process steps into such assessment is growing. This workshop is dedicated to sharing best practice in sustainability assessment amongst different stages of a chemical value-chain from feedstock procurers / producers to final product manufacturers through to end-of life management within a framework of responsible innovation.\nContext \nThere is a new growing need amongst the value chains to practice responsible innovation that is traceable, transparent and trustworthy. There are a number of decision-making stakeholders post-trade / distribution that influence the success / progress of a value chain: consumers, internal/ external policy-makers, investors, retailers, media etc. There is mounting pressure to balance these factors by optimising the operational value-chain and organisational behaviour via sustainability tracking, reporting and effective communication. However, undertaking these responsibilities to the highest accuracy, extensiveness of scope of reporting, transparency among cross-border stakeholders, and ultimately, the commitment of time and appropriate investment into these activities are currently major challenges. With a view to creating a dialogue and awareness of the various methods of tracing and quantifying how sustainable your supply chain, stakeholders and their practices may be, the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence is organising a “Tracking, measuring and reporting Responsible Innovation” event.\n\n\nThis event has been organised as part of the STAR-ProBio and Re-SAUCE projects. \nThe STAR-ProBio project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and innovation action under grant agreement No 727740 with the Research Executive Agency (REA) - European Commission. Duration: 36 months (May 2017 – April 2020). Work Programme BB-01-2016: Sustainability schemes for the bio-based economy.\nThe Re-SAUCE (Sustainable, Alternative Uses for food waste in the Circular Economy) project has received funding from the EPSRC under grant reference EP/P008771/1. Duration: 24 months (January 2017 – December 2018)."

The world of JavaScript frameworks has grown bigger and more complex. However, as of today, we see a few major players like React, Angular and Vue.js cementing their place. All of these are powerful complex beasts with a steep learning curve. Committing to any of the frameworks creates a major dependency for your organisation and a requirement for a specialised workforce capable of efficiently using the framework of choice. In addition, going with one of these frameworks locks you in the Frameworks ecosystem making it difficult to take advantage of developments in other JavaScript ecosystems. As we know the world of web development is an ever-changing environment and committing to a certain technology without a backup plan can have serious implications in the future.</p> <p>Today I would like to explore with you one possible solution for how we can introduce a backup plan for "safeguarding" the future of our JavaScript code and potentially take advantage of developments across different JavaScript ecosystems. This potential Solution is to build Web Components using our chosen JavaScript framework. I will talk about some of the options we have today with the top 3 JS frameworks and show a quick demo of how this can be done with Angular 6."</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
