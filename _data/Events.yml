    HALF-DAY CONFERENCE

    TEXTURE IN FORMULATIONS

    The SCS Scrub up on Science programme aims to make science fun for schoolchildren, so why can’t adults get in on the act too? This half-day seminar looks at the sensory world of beauty but will focus on the science of delivering products with the right texture and feel, all demonstrated in a ‘hands on’ practical way. Prepare to poke, wobble and spread!

    12.00-12.30pm Coffee & buffet lunch

    12.30-1.00pm SENSORY AND INDULGENCE IN THE WORLD OF BEAUTY Ronan Stafford Global Data This presentation will explore consumer behaviour and innovation in relation to key trends including:


    Experimentation – what drives experimentation and how is this translated into beauty innovation?

    Fresh, Natural and Pure – the importance of natural and how this is encouraging crossovers within food and drink.

    Premiumization and Indulgence – adding value and providing luxury experiences for today’s consumers.


    1.00-1.30pm RHEOLOGY, TEXTURE AND SENSORY: A MESSY PLAY SESSION Neil Cunningham Centre for Industrial Rheology You will never look at squirt of shower gel or a dollop of day cream in the same way again! For all its fearsome equations and complex measuring methods, rheology is in fact merely a methodical way of quantifying what you see and feel when you handle a product. Neil’s Messy Play session replaces the maths with a fun hands-on practical experience where participants will get to poke, wobble and spread a range of everyday products and learn how to recognise those behaviours that we take for granted but never explicitly acknowledge. He will then introduce the key rheological concepts and properties that describe those behaviours and will go on to relate those properties specifically to cosmetic and

    1.30-1.45pm coffee break

    1.45-3.15pm Interactive presentations on formulation and ingredients/textures led by:

    TABLE 1: Adeline Coulson Croda How the old can become the new A showcase of some of Croda’s innovative textures using ingredients in different combinations to create a variety of systems for various applications. Information on the formulations and the key ingredients used will be provided.

    TABLE 2: Helen Hill Azelis From Champagne to Ice Cubes – How to create a world of texture from one formulation During this session, Azelis will present a range of seven different textures created using the same base formulation.

    TABLE 3: Andrea Tomlinson BASF Using emulsion technology to offer new textures During the session a range of novel textures will be presented where traditional emulsion technology has been modified to bring new textures and application effects.

    Each of these three interactive sessions will last 30 minutes and will repeat three times with delegates moving around to each of the three tables.

    With high-speed railways planned across the world, budget limitations pressing for ever more efficient structures and the Paris Agreement demanding more sustainable solutions, there are many challenges to overcome in the rail sector.

    The UK chapter of the IGS want to educate the Industry about the use of geosynthetics in Rail. The symposium will showcase the established use of geosynthetics in rail applications from around the world for over 30 years. It will also discuss how they could be utilised in high speed networks to create steeper embankments, construct abutments, facilitate drainage and many other uses.

- name: Who is to blame for our lack of Agile progress?
  description: '<p>Who is to blame for our lack of Agile progress?</p> <p>The answers of course lie in the system and the underlying thinking of the organisation. There is no person to blame as we often look for with command &amp; control thinking.</p> <p>About Rachel Whitaker</p> <p>A decade of systems thinking experience and the joyful learns and successes which have come with that have only increased Rachel’s passion to share that experience with others. 95% of the performance of any system can be attributed to the system conditions, NOT the individuals in the system.</p> <p>Rachel has applied systems thinking principles at Aviva and outside of Aviva with colleagues in all areas of the business finding the same thinking producing the same results over and over again. Once you start systems thinking, you can never go back.<br/>Rachel is passionate about great customer experience, continuous learning, awesome colleague environments and systems thinking.

But there are other coding horrors that should trigger alarm bells whenever we see them, whether in a legacy codebase or when doing code reviews. Like a good horror movie, coding horrors should scare us when we find them, because they’re often symptomatic of deeper problems. So let’s take a short tour of some of the greatest horror movies ever made (and a few turkeys); and some of the most worrying code horrors that I’ve seen."</p> <p>Mark is ZCE; Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak; Coordinator of Open Source PHPOffice library suite (PHPExcel, PHPPowerPoint, PHPWord, &amp;c); Trainee cat herder.</p> <p>✩ A journey into API performance and security using PHP Silex<br/>Blair Garrett <a href="https://twitter.com/blairguk" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/blairguk</a></p> <p>"I’ll take you through the practices, tools and techniques I employed when making my best attempt to secure and speed up API’s. For this talk I’ll be using the PHP Silex framework. I’ll go through the reasons for my choice of tools which you can lean on. These will ensure your API goes like the clappers and the bad guys can’t get in. This is loosely based on a read world example. But I will be drawing on experience of creating API’s in Java, .NET, PHP and NodeJS over the years."</p> <p>Blair is a Developer at Sky.

Claire is the host of the popular ITSM Crowd hangouts, and Chief Architect for VeriSM.</p> <p>In the last 5 years, the world of IT has exploded with buzzwords, new ways of working, and the ever present demands to do more with less. Digital transformation is the latest phrase, but what does it actually mean? Claire is going to talk about the changes that are needed at the personal and organisational level for digital transformation to actually deliver results, and how the VeriSM approach has been written to help.</p> <p>Or second speaker is Bob Walker, Bob is one of the organising team behind DevopsDays London and claims to have been doing devops since before it was called devops and has been doing on call longer than that. bob is currently working at dxw as System Operations Engineer but has been the Supreme Ruler of the YAML engineers at the UK Government Digital Service and has only recently stopped being on call for GOV.UK.</p> <p>Bob's talk is \"Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview\" - Ever wondered how best to respond when an interviewer asks if you have any questions? Drawing on his experience from both sides of the table, bob offers some suggestions for questions which will not only make you look well-prepared but also help you decide whether you want to work there.</p> <p>We are again grateful to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.
