  description: >-
    With high-speed railways planned across the world, budget limitations pressing for ever more efficient structures and the Paris Agreement demanding more sustainable solutions, there are many challenges to overcome in the rail sector.

    The UK chapter of the IGS want to educate the Industry about the use of geosynthetics in Rail. The symposium will showcase the established use of geosynthetics in rail applications from around the world for over 30 years. It will also discuss how they could be utilised in high speed networks to create steeper embankments, construct abutments, facilitate drainage and many other uses.

- name: 'YSJ Terra Two, Workshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites'
  description: "NASA is currently aiming to settle the first human beings on MARS by 2030. Terra Two’s project designers suggest that writers, artists, musicians, philosophers and spiritual thinkers have an ethical responsibility to lend their voices to this far-sighted scientific experiment.  Terra Two is an online magazine/archive which was officially launched at York St John in September 2017 in order to collate science-fictional contributions from YSJ staff, postgraduate students, undergraduate students and invited guests in the form of writing, music, visual images, games and podcasts. The aim of these collected contributions is to help create a sustainable future for human beings as well as the non-human plant and animal species we directly impact upon, both on Earth and off-world. For our magazine, see https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com. This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

- name: LeedsDevops - March 2018 Meetup
  description: "<p>Spring is in the air and it’s time for a devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 27th March. We bring you an couple of brilliant talks:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : VeriSM - making sense of digital transformation - Claire Agutter<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview - Bob Walker<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>We are delighted to welcome back Claire Agutter for our first talk entitled \"VeriSM - making sense of digital transformation\". Claire is a service management trainer, consultant and author. In 2017 she was recognised as an HDI Top 25 Thought Leader and was part of the team that won itSMF UK’s thought leadership award. Claire is the host of the popular ITSM Crowd hangouts, and Chief Architect for VeriSM.</p> <p>In the last 5 years, the world of IT has exploded with buzzwords, new ways of working, and the ever present demands to do more with less. Digital transformation is the latest phrase, but what does it actually mean? Claire is going to talk about the changes that are needed at the personal and organisational level for digital transformation to actually deliver results, and how the VeriSM approach has been written to help.</p> <p>Or second speaker is Bob Walker, Bob is one of the organising team behind DevopsDays London and claims to have been doing devops since before it was called devops and has been doing on call longer than that. bob is currently working at dxw as System Operations Engineer but has been the Supreme Ruler of the YAML engineers at the UK Government Digital Service and has only recently stopped being on call for GOV.UK.</p> <p>Bob's talk is \"Questions you should ask at your \"DevOps\" interview\" - Ever wondered how best to respond when an interviewer asks if you have any questions? Drawing on his experience from both sides of the table, bob offers some suggestions for questions which will not only make you look well-prepared but also help you decide whether you want to work there.</p> <p>We are again grateful to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

Node.js has evolved massively over the last few years. Whilst there are lots of great tutorials on the internet on how to code in Node.js, some of them are quite old so they do not mention new ways of doing things, or techniques to help write Node.js code in a team. This talk aims to cover some of these missing gaps to help you write a great, maintainable application in Node.js\"</p> <p>John Bower - Supercharging Node with C++<br/>\"Node is incredibly powerful for creating web applications, however it's easy to block the event loop with processor-intensive functions. Offloading those functions to C++ can speed your application up massively. In this talk I will go through some of the techniques available to us, and how to make your application as highly performant as possible.\"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge. While recruiters are welcome to come and learn, we operate a strict no recruitment policy.
