    “Cold and Trapped: Using Lasers to Approach Absolute Zero”


    Given the rude interuption of a poorly timed fire alarm in his last attempt to give this lecture, Physsoc invites back Doctor Andrew Pratt from the York Physics Department. Here he will give (this time) a full explanation of how lasers can be used to cool objects - something not usually associated with them. Below is a summary of the lecture, along with a few figures, from Doctor Pratt to pique your interest.Our everyday experience tells us that if light shines on an object, then that object will heat up, as happens when the Sun’s rays warm our skin. However, lasers, the most powerful sources of light, can actually be used to cool atoms down to within a millionth of a degree of the lowest temperature that is theoretically possible, known as absolute zero (−273.15° Celsius or zero Kelvin). Over five decades, ever more sophisticated techniques, with exotic names such as Sisyphus cooling and optical molasses, have been developed that allow colder and colder temperatures to be reached. Such low temperatures are necessary to make improved measurements of the most fundamental properties of nature and for applications such as metrology and the atomic clocks used in global positioning systems (e.g. GPS). Exciting new technologies are also being explored such as quantum computers and lasers actually made of atoms instead of light. This talk will introduce the concept of ‘laser cooling’, the schemes used to achieve colder and colder temperatures, and how this field benefits our everyday lives.


    The figure shows an image of Sisyphus, a mythological king forever destined to roll a massive boulder to the top of a hill, only for it to continually roll back down again. Lasers can be used to create analogous ‘hills’ which allows atoms to be trapped and then cooled to ultralow temperatures.

Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

    MTA Networking Fundamentals

    Networking is crucial to computing and over time knowledge gaps occur which reduces effectiveness and performance of a team. In this course, we will focus on the fundamentals of networking concepts and current technologies.

    In today's increasingly connected and technology-driven businesses you need to know how communication and information transfers are enabled by networking technologies such as the internet, intranet, and extranet, local area networks, wide area networks, wireless networking, network topologies, and access methods. You will also build foundational knowledge in various networking concepts, including the OSI model, IP addressing, internet protocols, and more.

    This course is part of the core introductory Microsoft IT Infrastructure certification for anyone considering a career in technology.

    Business Continuity with Microsoft Azure

    This half day workshop shows how businesses large and small can benefit from using cloud-based backups in Microsoft Azure.

    Whether looking to protect your IaaS assets in Azure or other datacentre providers, or simply looking for a way to backup critical on-premises systems to the cloud, we will explore why this feature is highly popular. We will also examine how ASR can be used to bring servers online into a Disaster Recovery (DR) datacentre or how to use Azure as your DR site.

  description: "<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/0/8/600_459587368.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nEver since we moved on from machine code, programmers have been looking for the next best abstraction to represent our systems.  For a long time, objects seemed to fit the bill - conceptually simple, easy to work with, a good way to split up code.  But with the move to increasingly server-based systems and the need for easy parallelisation, the functional style previously used only by beardy academics has stepped into the limelight.</p> <p>\n\nSome say this functional nonsense is just a flash in the pan, the hipster programmer's flavour of the month.  I mean, who wants to swap object hierarchies and encapsulation for closures and monads?  Others say just because the world is made of objects doesn't mean our code should be - and besides, nobody really does proper OO anyway!</p> <p>\n\nSo which is the better paradigm, Object Oriented or Functional?  Tonight, we will find out once and for all!</p> <p>\n\nWe'll split you into roughly even groups of Functional Fans and Object-Oriented Aficionados, and get you to code solutions using your preferred style.  Within each group you'll be working in pairs on your own solution, so you can use whichever language you like.  Once coding time is up, we'll employ a sophisticated static analysis algorithm to prove mathematically which set of solutions is better.  That, or we'll just pick which ones look nice..</p> <p>\n\nThis night is suitable for anyone with at least a basic knowledge of programming, although an understanding of Functional or OO will help. Bring a laptop, if you can, with your choice of language ready for action.  If you can't, we'll pair you up with someone - hopefully with at least the same preferred programming style, if not the same preferred language!</p> <p>Food and drink will be provided.</p> <p>\n\nTo secure your space at this event please email us at : </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amsourcetechnology.com/events/techconnect@amsourcetechnology.co\">techconnect@amsourcetechnology.com</a></p> "

  description: >
    Bootham Talks are a series of informal lectures and discussions covering a wide range of subjects. Each topic is presented by someone passionate about their field and has opportunity for questions and discussion afterwards.


    The talks take place on the first Wednesday of each month in term time.


    The search for life elsewhere in space is one of the great unfinished works of the Enlightenment. Recent discoveries now make it highly likely that the search will be successful within a few decades.


    This introduction to the field looks at the techniques used in the quest, and the places we are expecting to find extraterrestrial life.
