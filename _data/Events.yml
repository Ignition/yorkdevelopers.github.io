- name: Language learning in your sleep
  description: >-
    Speaker: Professor Gareth Gaskell, Department of Psychology

    Merchant Adventurers’ Science Discovery Lecture

    While sleep remains in many ways deeply mysterious, researchers are now beginning to recognise the importance of sleep for memory and learning. In this talk Gareth will describe research carried out in his lab that has identified a crucial role for sleep in language acquisition, including ways in which both adults' and children's sleep can improve language learning. He will also talk about the mechanisms with which the brain uses sleep to aid learning, and discuss ways in which boosting your sleep might accelerate the learning process.

  description: "                   York  Science  Trail:   a new project\n\n                             Diversifying  York's  history \nvia Science, Technology, Engineering,  Medicine and  Mathematics.\n\n                        Will you or your group(s) get involved ?\n\nNB: February meeting will now be on Feb 6th, NOT Feb 13th\n\nOpen Meetings: Jan 9th, Feb 6th, March 13th\n12 noon; 2nd Mondays; King’s Manor Refectory\n                             email  JOHN BIBBY    jb43@york.ac.uk\n                                 \n\n===================\n                                    MORE  DETAILS  FOLLOWING  SOON!\n\n\n\n\n====   SEE BELOW FOR TEXT RELATING TO OUR FIRST MEETING ON 5 DECEMBER:\nThis is an OPEN meeting to discuss a proposed Science Trail for York. Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

I networked with like-minded IT Directors and Heads of IT, sharing some useful tools, practices and insights which I have transferred to the workplace. It has also provided me with a network of contacts that I can call upon when dealing with future challenges and when seeking advice.”</p> <p><i>Sunder Iyer, Project Manager, LexisNexis</i></p> <p>“The most useful sections of the ITBoss event was having a guest speaker on a subject area which I am very interested in my current role…there is a lot of focus on aligning with strategy. The lightning topics were great in that they were on three different topics, everyone at some point got involved in the discussions and they were time-boxed! A good event all round.”</p> <p><i>Philippa Rickard, Programme Manager, William Hill</i></p> '

The whole team is responsible for figuring out what’s needed to solve a problem. No ‘chucking it over the fence’, no ‘I’m waiting to get the requirements’, no ‘that wasn’t written on the card’. Let’s talk about how we can collaborate to develop great products.\"</p> <p><b>Session Two: The Rise of the Agile Architect</b></p> <p>Reda Hmeid, Technical Architect, Equal Experts</p> <p>Description: \"Architecture and Agile have had a fractious relationship since the latter was introduced to the world in 2001. In fact, there has been a constant argument that architects are no longer needed in the Agile world. </p> <p>However, architects working in an Agile way have been around for years, with unequivocal success. Long before the Agile Manifesto was signed.</p> <p>Here, we'll go through the characteristics and attributes of the Agile Architect that has seen them rise to prominence in recent years.\"</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be provided as usual.</p> "

- name: 'Bootham Talks presents: The Search for Extra-terrestrial Life'
  description: >
    Bootham Talks are a series of informal lectures and discussions covering a wide range of subjects. Each topic is presented by someone passionate about their field and has opportunity for questions and discussion afterwards.


    The talks take place on the first Wednesday of each month in term time.


    The search for life elsewhere in space is one of the great unfinished works of the Enlightenment. Recent discoveries now make it highly likely that the search will be successful within a few decades.


    This introduction to the field looks at the techniques used in the quest, and the places we are expecting to find extraterrestrial life.
