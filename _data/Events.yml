  description: >
    What is Robothon? Robothon is York Exponential’s 32-hour York city hackathon inspired by and focused on the advancement and innovation of collaborative robots (robots that are designed to work alongside and augment humans, not replace them).

    Why are we hosting Robothon?  Robothon’s intention is to introduce the average person to the capabilities of our robots. We will have our engineers on site at all times to introduce functionality and monitor safety, and during the event, attendees will hear from inspiring speakers and have the opportunity to participate in workshops as well as fun activities planned throughout.

    Where and when is Robothon? April 7th-8th

    Robothon will take place from the morning of Saturday, April 7th to the evening of Sunday, April 8th. This is to help usher in robot week which takes place the following week!

- name: LeedsDevops - April 2018 Meetup
  description: "<p>It's time for another devops meetup at the ODI Node in Leeds on Tuesday 17th April. The evening will be:</p> <p>6:45 - 7:15 : Doors open, have a chat, make some new devops friends<br/>7:15 - 7:25 : Group updates/news/announcements<br/>7:25 - 8:05 : Look Ma, no Code! Apache Kafka and KSQL<br/>8:05 - 8:20 : Intermission<br/>8:20 - 9:00 : Ansible Enterprise Grade<br/>9:00 - late : Decamp to the Wardrobe</p> <p>For those of you who squeezed into the ODI for our February meetup you will have heard from William Hill about their use of Kafka, we've invited Robin Moffat from Confluent to come and give us a deep dive in all things Kafka and streaming data.</p> <p>Robin is a Partner Technology Evangelist at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director and Developer Champion. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. He blogs at <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/</a> and <a href=\"http://rmoff.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rmoff.net/</a> (and previously <a href=\"http://ritt.md/rmoff\" class=\"linkified\">http://ritt.md/rmoff</a>) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff.</p> <p>Robin's talk us \"Look Ma, no Code! Building Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and KSQL\" - Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. These data pipelines can be built using configuration alone. In this talk, we'll see how easy it is to stream data from a database such as MySQL into Kafka using the Kafka Connect API. In addition, we'll use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and then stream this from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of code!</p> <p>Our second talk of the evening is from Phil Cornelius who is an Ansible Specialist for EMEA. He joined Red Hat in 2016 from Credit Suisse where he was responsible for the developer tools and services for 3000 applications, developed by 8000 developers globally. Phil's background is primarily application development, specifically Enterprise Java. Phil brings over 18 years of experience in what is now commonly called DevOps.</p> <p>As you introduce Ansible into your organisation there are additional requirements to make running Ansible ‘Enterprise Grade’. This session is a live demo of some of key use cases for Ansible in the Enterprise. You will get to see Ansible Tower with a specific focus on Application Lifecycle Management.</p> <p>We are again delighted to have Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) sponsor the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in\" class=\"linkified\">https://tmblr.co/ZdJfSq2PpSK99)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

This can lead to feelings of personal doubt (e.g. imposter syndrome) and mental fatigue. The suspiring truth is that these feelings of doubt are a natural response to 21st century life. This is because your brain is designed to survive and not flourish. This session will show how your brain is designed to work, why we sometimes doubt ourselves and beat ourselves up, and how we all can begin to build resilience.</p> <p>1. The dominant survival brain – the limbic regions<br/>2. Why dwelling on unhelpful thoughts can become an unhelpful habit<br/>3. The important role of the pre-frontal cortex in being resilient</p> <p>Dr. Jon Finn is the founder and Managing Director of Tougher Minds; passionate about making complex science simple, so that people can use these insights to be their best and help others to be at their best.</p> <p>Much of his current work is helping individuals, teams and managers in London, and the USA, to harness individual and team success in the challenging modern work and societal context. This work includes supporting developers working for banks, investment managers and high-growth start ups to be at their best.</p> <p>Jon has been working in the field of performance psychology and behaviour change for over 17 years. He completed his PhD at Leeds Beckett University investigating the role of emotional regulation in the challenging transitions of some of Britain’s most high-performing athletes. He has worked extensively in elite sport, particularly in professional football, rugby, cricket and golf.</p> <p>www.tougherminds.co.uk</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform <a href=\"https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform\" class=\"linkified\">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform</a> – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.

- name: Software Craftsmanship and Agile & Let's invent a team game!
  description: "<p>Let's invent a team game!</p> <p>Last year @AgileManc we explored the Real Roles team game. This went down so well that we decided to build a new game together. We have built the basic framework for a new card game. We have templates to speed things up and our printer is ready to create a professionally presented card deck. The rest is up to you...</p> <p>Using an iterative approach in this session, you will create, test and refine a new team game. Its aim will be to help teams to continuously improve. It also needs to have useful instructions and informative packaging. The end product will be a shiny new deck of cards designed by you, which we will send to everyone involved for free - fresh off the production line. Delegates can also opt in to be credited as co-creator in the online instructions.</p> <p>About Laurence Wood</p> <p>Creator of the Real Roles Agile team game, Laurence inspires teams to deliver more value, more often, using agile and lean in the UK and India. He discovered lean as a Jaguar Cars apprentice in 1988 supervising V12 XJS assembly and studying manufacturing engineering at The University of Birmingham. Ford’s takeover prompted his decision to move fully into IT with RAD (Rapid Application Development) agile pioneers Marks and Spencer in London. Freelance development lead roles followed in South Africa, Austria and the UK, including at Coca Cola and South African Airways. He later became a development manager then divisional head of IT in the demanding City of London investment banking arena. Now Yorkshire-based, he likes to inspire agile leaders to deliver more value more often.</p> "
