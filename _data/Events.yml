Please sign up if you are interested, even if you cannot come to the meeting. And tell your friends!\nDetails to follow: an aim is to eventually include all science-related places in York.\nWhat is \"Science\"?  We take a broad definition. It certainly includes all of \"STEMM\": Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics.\nWhat do we mean by \"York\"?  Again, our definition is broad. We can include outliers such as Cayley/ Scarborough/ Whitby/ Castle Howard etc.. However, initially we shall focus on places walkable from York city centre. Examples are below. But if you want to include something else, please join us! \nHow will this get published? All avenues are possible. Online, on-paper, on-air. Apps and baps and flaps. We want to rach and energise as many people as possible.\nWho is behind this? If the idea fails, you can blame John Bibby. If it succeeds, there will be many parents! So far we have had welcome inputs from the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, U3A, York Past and Present, Timeline York, York Bus Forum, local history societies and even a few schools and universities  I am sure we will get many more!\nPlease give some examples.  Some locations will be well-known, such as:\n\nCholera burial-ground\nNational Railway Museum\nTreasurer’s House\n\nBut we will also include lesser-known places & stories such as Thomas Laycock and the People’s Dispensary. I’d like all Local History groups to provide suggestions for inclusion from their local areas.\nOne idea is for the trail to zigzag round the city walls in a clockwise direction, starting and finish at the railway station. Plans are still at an early stage. The first thing to do is to develop a list of possible points on the trail, along with a list of potential partner organisations and individuals. Please volunteer or let John Bibby have your nominations for both of these lists.\nJohn can be contacted via jb43@york.ac.uk or on 01904-330334.\nPlease forward this link to anyone who might be interested!"

- name: Is Free Will an Illusion?
  description: >-
    While many believe that free will is vital for human dignity, morality and responsibility, others claim it is an illusion. But what exactly is free will? Do we have the kind of free will which gives us enough control over our own lives for our choices to make a difference? What about notions of blame and responsibility? Join philosopher Julian Baggini and psychologists Christian Jarrett and Adrian Raine to find out more.

- name: Technology for All? A story of bias in design
  description: >-
    Join us for a behind-the-scenes look at how ‘things’ are designed. This interactive workshop will explore how technologies have been developed – consciously or not – to favour certain users. Civil engineer Carolyn Dougherty will then explore ‘universal design’, showing how technology can be for everyone if challenges are met with common sense and empathy. Early booking is advised for the workshop as numbers are limited.

  description: "<p>For our session in May we'll get lost together, looking at various ways to generate mazes.  </p> <p>As usual, the session will begin with a description of the problem, followed by grouping into pairs to work on it, and brief presentation of solutions at the end.  This means you need to find somebody to work with on the day.  All languages are OK to use - as long as you can find somebody to pair with!  Bring a laptop, with plenty of charge :) </p> <p>BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME - A good one for any aspiring software developer to attend.  Students very welcome!</p> <p>NOTE: Food in pizza form will be provided.  On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p><i>The room for the York Code Dojo is FT/211.

  description: >
    Bootham Talks are a series of informal lectures and discussions covering a wide range of subjects. Each topic is presented by someone passionate about their field and has opportunity for questions and discussion afterwards.


    The talks take place on the first Wednesday of each month in term time.


    The search for life elsewhere in space is one of the great unfinished works of the Enlightenment. Recent discoveries now make it highly likely that the search will be successful within a few decades.


    This introduction to the field looks at the techniques used in the quest, and the places we are expecting to find extraterrestrial life.
