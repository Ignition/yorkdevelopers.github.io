Randal CEO / Owner at SQLskills.com - Performance Troubleshooting Using Wait Statistics</p> <p>One of the first things you should check when investigating performance issues are wait statistics - as these can often point you in the direction for further analysis. Unfortunately many people misinterpret what SQL Server is telling them and jump to conclusions about how to solve the problem - what is often called 'knee-jerk performance tuning'. In this session, you will learn what waits are, how to analyze them, and potential solutions to common problem patterns.</p> <p>About Paul</p> <p>Paul’s an author, consultant, and top-rated speaker having spoken at PASS, TechEd, SQLintersection, and numerous other events around the world. He spent 9 years working on the SQL Server team, writing DBCC CHECKDB, and ultimately responsible for the entire Storage Engine. In 2007 Paul left Microsoft to co-own and run SQLskills.com, and has been a SQL Server MVP ever since. When he's not tweeting, blogging, or helping someone recover from a disaster, he's likely to be underwater somewhere in the world with his wife, Kimberly L.

- name: 'All Our Futures: An education fit for the world of the mid-21st century'
  description: >
    What is education really about if not building the future?


    In modern times, the pace of change has quickened with every passing generation and shows no sign of slowing down. What sort of education does this generation of young people need to help it meet the demands, opportunities and challenges of that future? 


    Guided by the provocative thoughts of real experts in the fields of AI, biotechnology, the environment, the economy, lifespan & the future of work, and societal values/morality, delegates will work together to draw up A Manifesto for an Education for All Our Futures which will be shared with policy makers and opinion formers around the country. 


    The speakers are:


    Rohit Talwar CEO Fast Future Research: international speaker and consultant; joint author of Future Reinvented – Reimagining Life, Society, and Business and Beyond Genuine Stupidity – Ensuring AI Serves Humanity


    Kresse Wesling Environmental entrepreneur and campaigner: founder of Elvis & Kresse, which turns industrial waste into innovative lifestyle products and returns 50% of profits to charities and organisations related to the waste


    Nick Gowing Journalist and presenter with BBC News 24, ITN and Channel 4 News; extensive reporting experience in diplomacy, defence and international security; currently Visiting Professor in the School of Social Science and Public Policy at Kings College, London


    Jules Evans Policy Director of Centre for the History of the Emotions, Queen Mary University, London; author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations and The Art of Losing Control


    Mike Shaw is a full-time geek, teaching non-stop at Bootham School since the 80s.  He is passionately interested in the future because that’s where he intends to spend the rest of his life.  His only regret is that he was born too late to meet Isaac Newton and too soon to visit Mars


    Hosted by:


    Chris Jeffery Headmaster of Bootham School and Bristol Rovers fan
