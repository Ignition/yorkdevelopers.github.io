  description: >-
    If you’re interested in dance or psychology don’t miss this exciting event.

    In this interactive event, Prof. Emily Cross from the University of Glasgow explores what the latest neuroscience research reveals about what’s going on inside our heads as we watch dancers that inspire us to get out of our seats and feel the groove.

    Prof. Emily Cross is the professor of Social Robotics at University of Glasgow’s institute of Neuroscience and Psychology. Social robotics concentrates on the development and design of robots which interact socially with humans. Emily’s team has been focusing on the psychology behind highly skilled motor functions, such as dance, music, gymnastics, contortion, and acrobatics.

Having qualified in the pharmacy industry his career has been tightly coupled with healthcare. He has worked primarily on the operational side of IT, for the last 7 years providing technical solutions for delivering large enterprise applications to NHS organisations for EMIS Health. Today he focuses on how they can deliver faster and to more complex environments.</p> <p>Sam will walk you through how EMIS are exploring and adopting a hybrid on-prem-cloud solution along with the Hashicorp toolset, to provide more efficient DevTest environments for some of their monolithic applications in a very traditional Microsoft stack software house.</p> <p>Our second talk is from Nicolas Corrarello of Hashicorp. He says \"The times, they are a changing. Generalised splat operators, GRPC, for loops. Join me on a quick tour of the new features of Terraform 0.12”</p> <p>Nicolas Corrarello's background includes 6+ years of Unix and Windows Server system administration roles, managing AIX/Solaris/Linux and different versions of Windows Server (2000 AS and above) systems in different companies. Nicolas also worked two years as a support engineer and instructor/examiner for Red Hat delivering RHCE/RHCA courses. As an open source enthusiast, he has more IT in his house than appliances. While he spent years doing things manually, he’s now a firm believer that the IT practice needs to evolve and rise to the challenges of current times. He's currently the Regional Director for Hashicorp’s Solutions Engineering team in Europe.</p> <p>Once again we say a massive \"Thank You\" to Infinity Works (<a href=\"https://www.infinityworks.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.infinityworks.com/</a>) for sponsoring the refreshments and lodgings for the evening, ensuring there are plenty of our favourite refreshments and soft drinks in supply.</p> <p>Code Of Conduct</p> <p>Please note that we have now added an anti harassment policy and code of conduct <a href=\"http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.leedsdevops.org.uk/post/165145559625/code-of-conduct)in</a> order to support the inclusive nature of the meetup.

Originally from the UK, he has lived in Vancouver since 2003, and is now a dual citizen of Canada and the UK.</p> <p>He was foundational in the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), working full-time on that project for ConsenSys from October 2016 to October 2017. He co-presented the Technical Roadmap at the EEA launch event and served first as Secretary of the Technical Working Group and subsequently as Vice-Chair of the Technical Steering Committee.</p> <p>That role followed a spell at the Ethereum Foundation, where he was a developer on the cpp-ethereum client, leading a major refactoring and revamp of the codebase (cpp-ethereum-1.3.0 \"Homecoming\") and led a failed effort at re-licensing cpp-ethereum which was intended to open up the possibility of an Ethereum client within Hyperledger seven months before Monax made that a reality.</p> <p>Bob will be giving a 1 hour talk as the headline speaker plus we will also be announcing our next blockchain hackathon following on from the successful one in November.</p> <p>After the talks there will be opportunity to network and ask further questions on campus.</p> <p>Address:<br/>Leeds University Business School<br/>Maurice Keyworth Building<br/>Moorland Road<br/>LS6 1AN, Leeds, UK</p> <p>Room: G02 (lecture hall next to the reception)<br/>Time: 18:00 – 20:00 + networking</p> <p>The Leeds University Union Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Society (LUUCABS) has as its objective to ensure that people can access as much knowledge as possible surrounding the topics of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This comprises organisation of events such as trading and investing tutorials, blockchain coding lectures and hackathons.
