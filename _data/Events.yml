- name: How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help those living with Parkinson’s
  description: >-
    Speaker(s):  Professor Stephen Smith, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are influencing our everyday lives - finding the quickest route home, predicting what we might want to buy and even finding us the perfect partner - but can it also help those living with Parkinson’s?  Parkinson’s is a devastating condition that affects 1 in 100 of those over 60 and currently has no cure. It costs the UK over £2 billion per annum and numbers are set to rise as we all live longer.

    In this lecture we will see how evolutionary algorithms, a form of machine learning, can help diagnose and monitor Parkinson’s, assist in the prescription of medication, and find new drugs to slow or even halt this debilitating condition.

    This talk will be preceded by a drinks reception in P/T/005A in the Exhibition Centre at 5.30pm  - open to all ticketholders.

- name: First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Rail Competition Briefing - York
  description: "“Demonstrating tomorrow’s stations and a greener railway” \r\nOpens 8 October 2018 \r\nDo you have an innovative product and service that is ready for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?\r\nOr are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling stock, infrastructure or stations?\r\nIf so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the first time in real-world rail environments.”\r\nThe themes for this FoaK2 competition are:\r\n\r\nDecarbonising the railways: Decarbonisation is a priority across the network, including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies, energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies, novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.\r\nCustomer experience in stations: This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision of the ‘station of the future’.\r\n\r\nInnovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness and integration into the railway system.\r\nFoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.\r\nInnovations for this competition must be:\r\n\r\nHigh TRL proven technologies – i.e. market ready\r\nVery low technology risk\r\nThe focus will be on: Integration activities; Demonstration proof of concept to customers and end-users; Collecting feedback from customers and users; Real innovations in the real world\r\n\r\nBusinesses can apply for a share of a substantial pot of money for First of a Kind technology to demonstrate aspects of tomorrow’s railway today. This competition offers the potential of 100% funding, with projects starting in early 2019.\r\nNot able to attend? There will also be briefings in London (11th October), where the scope and competition process presentations will also be available via webcast, and Cardiff (17th October).\r\n "

    "The Global Problem of Pharmaceutical Pollution" with Professor Alistair Boxall

    We will probably all use pharmaceuticals at some stage in our life. Following use, pharmaceuticals are excreted into the sewage system and can then pass through sewage treatment plants into surface waters. Pharmaceuticals can also be released during the manufacturing process or as a result of disposal of unused medicines. 

    As pharmaceuticals are biologically active molecules, in recent years there has been increasing interest from scientists and the general public over the potential impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms and on humans that consume drinking water containing pharmaceuticals.

    In this talk, Alistair will describe the work he is doing in York to understand the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments across the globe and the implications for ecological and human health. Solutions to minimise the impacts of pharmaceuticals on the environment will also be presented.

     

    Alistair Boxall is Professor in Environmental Science in the University of York’s Environment and Geography Department. His research focuses on understanding emerging and future ecological and health risks posed by chemical contaminants in the natural environment. 

    Alistair is a past member of the Defra Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances and past Chair of the Pharmaceutical Advisory Group of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. He regularly advises national and international organisations on issues relating to chemical impacts on the environment and has published extensively on his field.

    Alistair has coordinated major European projects and is Director of the York City Environment Observatory Initiative. He received the 2016 Recipharm International Environmental Award for his work on the impacts of chemical contaminants on the environment.

After weighing up the options I settled on using Ghost. In this talk, I'll discuss my reasons for choosing Ghost, as well as how I set up and hosted my own instance. By the end of the talk, I hope you'll have the same love of Ghost as I do and will want to set up your own instance!</p> <p>Ian Thomas - Programming Safely With Types<br/>When people talk about types they tend to think about type systems or, more specifically, static type systems. In JavaScript this landscape has been dominated by TypeScript and Flow with some minority adoption of statically typed functional programming languages that compile to JS (like Elm or PureScript). The benefits of static types are well documented, notably better IDE integration/tooling and the ability to catch a certain classification of bugs at compile time, not run time. An often overlooked part of this puzzle is there is still a lack of type checking at run time, so no matter how well defined our programs, there’s every chance that an external source can provide us with data that causes our program to explode.</p> <p>But, all hope is not lost! What if we could use some of the core features of JavaScript to provide runtime guarantees as to the correctness of our software? Even if you aren’t using TypeScript…<br/>--------------<br/>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

He is currently leading the team building an app to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy for the NHS utilising some of the latest tech: Xamarin, microservices with Azure Functions and .NET Core.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>How do you scale an over engineered monolith intended for millions of users?<br/>How do you fix bugs and add new features to a codebase that's impossible to understand?<br/>How can you avoid rewriting everything yet make the application perform as it was intended?<br/>How do you do all of this while the app is LIVE and being used by many users every day?<br/>The answer: restructure it into small maintainable chunks – microservices!</p> <p>Callum will discuss the process he followed to transition an app for the NHS into a majestically constructed microservices architecture, the lessons learnt and pain points felt along the way.</p> <p>We'll take a look at the infrastructure components you can use with limited knowledge to get started using microservices, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway to build a large API.</p> <p>Finally we'll take a look into the code and have a look at the iterative changes we had to make to ensure our old monolithic app could scale, such as building a new authentication \"service\" based on IdentityServer and restructuring specific components into Azure Functions!</p> <p>Our second speaker is Tom Parrish, one of Crisp's Senior Developers. C# is constantly evolving so you can write the most advanced coding of your career. With C#8 rumoured to launch later this year, Tom will guide you through the key features and share ideas on how you can use them in 2019.</p> "

- name: How to parse a file and Kotlin for the curious
  description: "<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, \"How to parse a file\" and \"Kotlin for the curious\" both being presented by Matt Ellis.</p> <p>**How to parse a file**</p> <p>Yes, we're going to look at file parsing. Sounds a bit boring, right? Wrong.</p> <p>In this talk, just for fun, we'll find out how to parse a file. We'll look at simple, handcrafted parsers. We'll finally figure out just how lex and yacc work. And we'll pick apart structured parsers that build abstract syntax trees as you type - ReSharper style. How is an IDEs parser different to a compiler? How do you handle sensible error recovery? What about significant whitespace?</p> <p>Everything you always wanted to know about parsing a file, but were too afraid to ask.</p> <p>**Kotlin for the curious**</p> <p>Interested in Kotlin? And why not - it’s a pragmatic language designed to remove ceremony, solve real world problems and still feel familiar to newcomers. It can target the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native code, even running on iOS. That’s a lot of reach for a single programming language.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll go on a high level, introductory tour of Kotlin - how to get up and running, what Kotlin looks like, and how to write idiomatic, concise code - functional or object oriented. We’ll look at data classes, top level and first class functions, inlining, null safety and more, including the design decisions behind some of the language choices. We’ll see how you can build DSLs, with examples from Android and HTML, and look at how we can build multi-platform projects. And we’ll take a look at coroutines, Kotlin’s answer to C#’s async/await.</p> <p>**Bio***<br/>Matt Ellis is a developer at JetBrains, working on the Developer Advocacy team. He has 20+ years of experience shipping software, having been a developer, team lead and technical authority for companies such as BBC Worldwide, BNP Paribas and Egg, the UK’s first internet bank. During that time, he has worked with a variety of platforms and technologies, from C++ and Unix to C#, Reactive Extensions and the Web. He currently works with language tooling, having fun with abstract syntax trees and source code analysis. He owns and contributes to various open source projects, and believes in the open closed principle.</p> "
