How can personalised video stories be crafted to present data to the public in an inclusive and engaging manner? What stories can be told with data and how will you craft a data-driven narrative?</p> <p>Personalized and interactive documentaries such as <a href="https://donottrack-doc.com/en/intro/">Do Not Track</a>, and <a href="http://www.netwars-project.com/webdoc">Netwars</a> demonstrate the potential for video based storytelling to tackle substantive topics such as privacy, the web economy and cyberwarfare.</p> <p>This will be a hands-on session building working prototypes of personalised video stories and developing innovative scenarios and use-cases for this emergent medium. Over the course of the weekend we will explore different data-driven approaches to creating personalised narratives and devise new ways to support public engagement with data.</p> <p>Presented by the EPSRC funded Perspective Media project (Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement), the event will provide a space for exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society.</p> <p>Project partnersBBC R&amp;DThe Open Data InstituteThe Digital CatapultCity of York CouncilBAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen</p> <p>Who should attend?</p> <p>Anyone interested in data-driven, non-linear and innovative modes of storytelling. Do you produce video content to tell engaging stories? Do you understand challenges associated with data literacy and accessibility? Are you a coding ninja? Open data maestro? A Data wrangler? Do you know how to extract patterns and insights from large datasets? If so, we want you along!</p> <p>In particular we encourage:</p> <p>Students of Interactive Media / Data Journalism /Film &amp; Television ProductionUser Experience &amp; Interaction DesignersFilmmakersData Scientists &amp; Data Engagement specialists</p> <p>Why you should attend</p> <p>This will be an exciting opportunity to experiment with an emergent form of interactive data-driven storytelling and get hands on experience of using object based media tools and libraries created by the University of York and BBC R&amp;D.</p> <p>There will be coaching and feedback sessions with experts in interactive media to help you create something exciting. There is also the possibility for ongoing support and development of a successful protoype created during the hackathon.</p> <p>Further details</p> <p>All meals will be provided throughout the course of the weekend.

- name: Kafka at the BBC & Kafka ops at Sky B&G
  description: "<p>Join us for the 2nd Leeds Apache Kafka meetup on May 29th from 6:00pm hosted by Sky Betting and Gaming in Leeds. The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there!</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm: Doors open<br/>6:30pm - 7:00pm: Pizza &amp; Drinks &amp; Chat<br/>7:00pm - 7:45pm: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka - David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming<br/>7:45pm - 8:30pm: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure - Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>8:30 pm - 9:00pm: Additional Q&amp;A and Networking</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: Please can I have a Kafka Cluster? Meeting the operational scale of Kafka<br/>- Speaker: David Sunter, Sky Betting and Gaming.<br/>- Abstract: How Platform Services have gone from supporting 4 Kafka Clusters in 2017, to creating 9 Clusters so far in 2018. Scaling the amount of Clusters to met the demand of SBG and how it's become an integral part of the company's future.<br/>- Bio: David joined SBG in 2016, after background in aerospace engineering. After exploring a range of roles in devops, across SBG, David joined Platform Services where for the last year he has supported Kafka as a service. Kafka is now a key component in the running of real time services for both the Betting and Gaming tribes. David has interests in statistics, analytics and asking the question why? Outside of work he is a passionate sports fan and dog lover.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>- Title: As Above, So Below – Building Microservice Pipelines with Kafka and Clojure<br/>- Speaker: Dan Meyers, BBC<br/>- Abstract: In the beginning was PIPs, an API backed by a relational database used to store all the BBC's programme metadata. But as more clients came, with more requirements and ever more complex queries, the system became unwieldy to develop and use. The Programme Metadata team turned to a combination of a Kafka platform and Clojure microservices running in AWS to produce multiple pipelines, one per client requirement. This setup turns the normal ETL pipeline on its head, with one consistent backend and multiple differing outputs. This talk will show some common patterns used by the team, how they use the microservice approach to quickly spin up new client pipelines, and how the structure of Clojure mirrors and supports the way they use Kafka.<br/>- Bio: Dan graduated in 2004 and spent 10 years working as a Network Engineer. In 2014, realising that the bits of the job he enjoyed the most all involved coding, he changed tack to become a Software Engineer for the BBC in Manchester, UK. He is now a Senior Software Engineer in the Programme Metadata team, delivering scalable and reliable APIs used as part of the backend to the BBC's programme distribution through iPlayer, /programmes, schedule EPGs, and third parties like Sky and Virgin's on-demand services or the American \"BritBox\" streaming platform. He has the world's best Labrador.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>The full address for the venue is:</p> <p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming<br/>3rd Floor<br/>6 Wellington Place<br/>Leeds<br/>LS1 4AP</p> <p>For people who have visited the Sky Betting &amp; Gaming offices previously, this is our new building.</p> <p>There is wheelchair access.

However, this usually means that we also have an app for each device taking up space on our phones, no matter how infrequently we use it. Wouldn’t it be great if we could just use the web?</p> <p>With Web Bluetooth, we can control these devices through the browser! In this talk we’ll take a look at the basics of Web Bluetooth, the Bluetooth Low Energy GATT layer and how to use these through JavaScript using the practical example of how I built an interactive LED pixel display. By the end, I hope you’ll be inspired to try controlling your Bluetooth devices through the browser!"</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.

- name: 'All Our Futures: An education fit for the world of the mid-21st century'
  description: >
    What is education really about if not building the future?


    In modern times, the pace of change has quickened with every passing generation and shows no sign of slowing down. What sort of education does this generation of young people need to help it meet the demands, opportunities and challenges of that future? 


    Guided by the provocative thoughts of real experts in the fields of AI, biotechnology, the environment, the economy, lifespan & the future of work, and societal values/morality, delegates will work together to draw up A Manifesto for an Education for All Our Futures which will be shared with policy makers and opinion formers around the country. 


    The speakers are:


    Rohit Talwar CEO Fast Future Research: international speaker and consultant; joint author of Future Reinvented – Reimagining Life, Society, and Business and Beyond Genuine Stupidity – Ensuring AI Serves Humanity


    Kresse Wesling Environmental entrepreneur and campaigner: founder of Elvis & Kresse, which turns industrial waste into innovative lifestyle products and returns 50% of profits to charities and organisations related to the waste


    Nick Gowing Journalist and presenter with BBC News 24, ITN and Channel 4 News; extensive reporting experience in diplomacy, defence and international security; currently Visiting Professor in the School of Social Science and Public Policy at Kings College, London


    Jules Evans Policy Director of Centre for the History of the Emotions, Queen Mary University, London; author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations and The Art of Losing Control


    Mike Shaw is a full-time geek, teaching non-stop at Bootham School since the 80s.  He is passionately interested in the future because that’s where he intends to spend the rest of his life.  His only regret is that he was born too late to meet Isaac Newton and too soon to visit Mars


    Hosted by:


    Chris Jeffery Headmaster of Bootham School and Bristol Rovers fan
