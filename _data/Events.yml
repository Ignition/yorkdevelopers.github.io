- name: How Artificial Intelligence and machine learning can help those living with Parkinson’s
  description: >-
    Speaker(s):  Professor Stephen Smith, Department of Electronic Engineering

    Electronic Engineering Inaugural Lecture

    Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are influencing our everyday lives - finding the quickest route home, predicting what we might want to buy and even finding us the perfect partner - but can it also help those living with Parkinson’s?  Parkinson’s is a devastating condition that affects 1 in 100 of those over 60 and currently has no cure. It costs the UK over £2 billion per annum and numbers are set to rise as we all live longer.

    In this lecture we will see how evolutionary algorithms, a form of machine learning, can help diagnose and monitor Parkinson’s, assist in the prescription of medication, and find new drugs to slow or even halt this debilitating condition.

    This talk will be preceded by a drinks reception in P/T/005A in the Exhibition Centre at 5.30pm  - open to all ticketholders.

- name: First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Rail Competition Briefing - York
  description: "“Demonstrating tomorrow’s stations and a greener railway” \r\nOpens 8 October 2018 \r\nDo you have an innovative product and service that is ready for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?\r\nOr are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling stock, infrastructure or stations?\r\nIf so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the first time in real-world rail environments.”\r\nThe themes for this FoaK2 competition are:\r\n\r\nDecarbonising the railways: Decarbonisation is a priority across the network, including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies, energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies, novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.\r\nCustomer experience in stations: This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision of the ‘station of the future’.\r\n\r\nInnovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness and integration into the railway system.\r\nFoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.\r\nInnovations for this competition must be:\r\n\r\nHigh TRL proven technologies – i.e. market ready\r\nVery low technology risk\r\nThe focus will be on: Integration activities; Demonstration proof of concept to customers and end-users; Collecting feedback from customers and users; Real innovations in the real world\r\n\r\nBusinesses can apply for a share of a substantial pot of money for First of a Kind technology to demonstrate aspects of tomorrow’s railway today. This competition offers the potential of 100% funding, with projects starting in early 2019.\r\nNot able to attend? There will also be briefings in London (11th October), where the scope and competition process presentations will also be available via webcast, and Cardiff (17th October).\r\n "

- name: Systems Change Thinking - Closing the Loop
  description: "Systems Change Thinking - Creating Value and Closing the Loop from Unavoidable Food Supply Chain Wastes\nWe are delighted to announce an opportunity to attend a free, one-day event on understanding the chemical and environmental benefits of utilising unavoidable food supply chain wastes (UFSCW). Current strategies for dealing with UFSCW are rudimentary and of low value: these include waste to energy (including incineration and anaerobic digestion), animal feed and bedding; composting; ploughing back in to soil; and, least preferably, landfill. \nIn response, this event explores UFSCW as a unique bioresource: a treasure trove of unexploited, bio-based materials and chemicals, with a range of potential commercial applications underpinned by holistic life-cycle thinking.\nThe event will be of particular interest to companies of all sizes wishing to valorise food waste streams as well as academics and policy makers. Particular benefits to attendees include:\n\n\nAn introduction to the new Sustainable Waste Valorisation Identifier (SWaVI)  tool which enables companies to identify and compare different potential valorisation strategies based on economic viability as well as sustainability and technological readiness.\n\n\nA chance to listen to key industrialists, academics and consultants discuss valorisation from not only a company, but also a more holistic supply chain perspective.\n\n\nThe opportunity to hear from leading academic and industrial speakers about the latest, novel, technical approaches to food waste valorisation.\n\n\nThe ability to interact and connect with researchers, industrialists and policy makers interested in collaborative UK and global projects.\n\n\nPoster abstract submission deadline\nThe deadline for poster abstract submission is Monday 29th October.\n\n\nDownload the abstract template form\n\n\nSubmit your completed abstract form to sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk as a word document or share as a Google Doc\n\n\nContributed poster presentations A0 format \n\n\nProgramme\nSession One: Holistic Systems Change (Chair: Professor Shahin Rahimifard, Loughborough University)\nSession Two: Change, Technology and Methodologies (Chair: Professor Timothy Foster, University of Nottingham)\nSession Three: Influencing Systems Change (Chair: Dr Avtar Matharu, University of York)\nLunch and refreshments provided.\nInvited Speakers\nHugh Powell Product Technology Centre, Nestlé\nZainudin Umar Global Food Structure & Ingredient Science, PepsiCo International\nSponsorship\nIf you would like to sponsor or exhibit at the event, please contact sophie.palmer@york.ac.uk for more details.\nWe gratefully acknowledge funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Re-SAUCE project EP/P008771/1) which has contributed to the organisation of this free event."

- name: 'Attracting and Retaining Women in STEM: The Conference'
  description: >+
    Workforce diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sector is a major challenge. Careers are male-dominated; just 9% of Engineering, 19% of Computer studies and 38% of Maths graduates are female. In fact, just 13% of the entire UK STEM workforce is female. Forward Ladies want to challenge and change these statistics. 

    We invite senior leaders from business, academia and policy to attend and represent their organisations.

    The action-packed day offers a schedule which includes insightful and thought-provoking presentations from women and men paving the way for diversity within the industry, audience Q&A sessions and of course, fantastic networking opportunities.

    From practical advice on effective ways to navigate your career to the opportunity to learn from the experiences of successful women, you will come away with valuable and actionable ideas and guidance. This conference will provide you with a unique opportunity to:



    Gain the latest best practice insights from policy experts and practitioners

    Develop strategies to enhance the impact and progression of women in STEM

    Shape future policies within the industry and influence them into working practices

    Understanding the educational paths which lead to careers in STEM

    Build lasting relationships with peers

- name: How to parse a file and Kotlin for the curious
  description: "<p>This event will be broken down into 2 talks, \"How to parse a file\" and \"Kotlin for the curious\" both being presented by Matt Ellis.</p> <p>**How to parse a file**</p> <p>Yes, we're going to look at file parsing. Sounds a bit boring, right? Wrong.</p> <p>In this talk, just for fun, we'll find out how to parse a file. We'll look at simple, handcrafted parsers. We'll finally figure out just how lex and yacc work. And we'll pick apart structured parsers that build abstract syntax trees as you type - ReSharper style. How is an IDEs parser different to a compiler? How do you handle sensible error recovery? What about significant whitespace?</p> <p>Everything you always wanted to know about parsing a file, but were too afraid to ask.</p> <p>**Kotlin for the curious**</p> <p>Interested in Kotlin? And why not - it’s a pragmatic language designed to remove ceremony, solve real world problems and still feel familiar to newcomers. It can target the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native code, even running on iOS. That’s a lot of reach for a single programming language.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll go on a high level, introductory tour of Kotlin - how to get up and running, what Kotlin looks like, and how to write idiomatic, concise code - functional or object oriented. We’ll look at data classes, top level and first class functions, inlining, null safety and more, including the design decisions behind some of the language choices. We’ll see how you can build DSLs, with examples from Android and HTML, and look at how we can build multi-platform projects. And we’ll take a look at coroutines, Kotlin’s answer to C#’s async/await.</p> <p>**Bio***<br/>Matt Ellis is a developer at JetBrains, working on the Developer Advocacy team. He has 20+ years of experience shipping software, having been a developer, team lead and technical authority for companies such as BBC Worldwide, BNP Paribas and Egg, the UK’s first internet bank. During that time, he has worked with a variety of platforms and technologies, from C++ and Unix to C#, Reactive Extensions and the Web. He currently works with language tooling, having fun with abstract syntax trees and source code analysis. He owns and contributes to various open source projects, and believes in the open closed principle.</p> "
