     Frequently Asked Questions

    Last year the tickets were divided into age groups, why has it changed?



    We decided to create tickets that are open to all age groups this year, to avoid the problem of a single group getting sold out too fast. When you register for a ticket the website will ask your age, and this information is important to us so we can cater our future events to our audience.



    Thanks for your patience as we try something new this year!



    What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?



    Guelph Transit buses arrive at the University of Guelph Bus Loop every hour and half hour.

    What if I don't give photo permission?



    Let's Talk Science requests your permission to take photos for the use of promotion and fundraising for future events. We do not publish names of anyone in the photographs, but we may post them on our social media platforms. In addition, this is a public event so media such as local newspaper photographers and video crew may be on site, so we cannot guarantee that you or your child will not be photographed.

    If I make a donation now, can I get tickets early? 



    In the interest of fairness, tickets will be available to EVERYONE on a first-come-first-served basis.  



    My child doesn't have a costume to wear, what can I do?



    Costumes are not required. However, we offer free face painting and wand-making at the event, as well as a "photo booth" where your child can have their turn to dress up like a wizard. 



    Do we sign up for individual classes?



    This event runs mostly as a large "Station Rotation". Some events are scheduled, such as our "Magical Lecture Series", so please refer to your Marauder's Map on the day-of for details. We will send the map in advance via email to EventBrite attendees. Please note that last-minute sign-ups may miss the email, but you will receive a printed map at the front door.
