  description: >-
      

    An engagement event to update companies, academics & organisations looking to put proposals in the £10m Round 2 Medicines Manufacturing Challenge Fund call.

    A further round of £10m funding call for innovative projects in medicines manufacturing opens on 12th March. This funding comes from Wave 1 of the ISCF Leading Edge Healthcare Challenge.

    The KTN is working with Innovate UK on an engagement event to update companies, academics and organisations looking to put proposals into this call.

    Join Innovate UK and the KTN at this event in York where you will have the opportunity to hear the latest on this as well as pitch for partners and network with others in the sector. Some scope details are listed below and or read the full document here: There will also be an Innovate UK run webinar on 20 March for the official competition launch –register here.

    Scope information:

    This competition aims to stimulate the development of innovative methods or technologies to improve the manufacture of novel medicines for human use.

    ‘Novel’ medicines are those that have not yet been commercially launched on the market but may have been applied as part of clinical trials or under exemptions from the UK Human Medicines Regulations.

    Proposals can include, but are not limited to, approaches that have the potential to deliver:



    improved commercially viable manufacturing processes

    methods for the reliable and robust scale-up of production of novel medicines

    increased yield of active ingredient

    lower cost of production and goods



    In each case there must be reason to expect an improvement in excess of 25%. Small incremental improvements will be deemed to be outside scope.

    In this competition medicines that are in scope and can be used as examplar products are limited to:



    advanced therapy medicinal products

    natural product medicines

    nucleic acid-based drugs

    prophylactic vaccines

    protein or peptide biopharmaceuticals

    small molecular weight pharmaceuticals

    virus and phage therapeutics

- name: Workshop on Data-Driven Video Storytelling @ The University of York
  description: >-
    Perspective Media: Personalised Video Storytelling for Data Engagement is an EPSRC funded research project exploring how personalized, interactive video stories can provide more accessible, informative and pleasurable ways for the public to engage with the increasing amounts of data that exist about us in modern society. In collaboration with our partners BBC R&D, The Open Data Institute, The Digital Catapult, City of York Council, BAFTA-winning immersive media producer Catherine Allen and others, we aim to exploit the power of video storytelling for engagement and literacy with data, and the potential of data analytics to reveal new opportunities for storytelling.

    To kick-off the project, we are hosting a 1-day research workshop at the University of York. This workshop will bring together academics, stakeholders from the creative industries and experts in data engagement to explore the opportunities and challenges posed by data-driven video stories. We will begin by sharing and discussing our research vision and plans. The remainder of the day will then be dedicated to the hands-on, experimental development of ideas and concepts for Perspective Media content, and the interrogation of those ideas in terms of the aesthetic, practical and ethical challenges they reveal. The workshop is the first in a series of activities that will be held over the next 18 months, including hackathons and the collaborative production of experimental content. We hope that you can join us to explore the potential of this exciting new content form.

    We hope that you will be able to join us in York!

    With high-speed railways planned across the world, budget limitations pressing for ever more efficient structures and the Paris Agreement demanding more sustainable solutions, there are many challenges to overcome in the rail sector.

    The UK chapter of the IGS want to educate the Industry about the use of geosynthetics in Rail. The symposium will showcase the established use of geosynthetics in rail applications from around the world for over 30 years. It will also discuss how they could be utilised in high speed networks to create steeper embankments, construct abutments, facilitate drainage and many other uses.

    HALF-DAY CONFERENCE

    TEXTURE IN FORMULATIONS

    The SCS Scrub up on Science programme aims to make science fun for schoolchildren, so why can’t adults get in on the act too? This half-day seminar looks at the sensory world of beauty but will focus on the science of delivering products with the right texture and feel, all demonstrated in a ‘hands on’ practical way. Prepare to poke, wobble and spread!

    12.00-12.30pm Coffee & buffet lunch

    12.30-1.00pm SENSORY AND INDULGENCE IN THE WORLD OF BEAUTY Ronan Stafford Global Data This presentation will explore consumer behaviour and innovation in relation to key trends including:


    Experimentation – what drives experimentation and how is this translated into beauty innovation?

    Fresh, Natural and Pure – the importance of natural and how this is encouraging crossovers within food and drink.

    Premiumization and Indulgence – adding value and providing luxury experiences for today’s consumers.


    1.00-1.30pm RHEOLOGY, TEXTURE AND SENSORY: A MESSY PLAY SESSION Neil Cunningham Centre for Industrial Rheology You will never look at squirt of shower gel or a dollop of day cream in the same way again! For all its fearsome equations and complex measuring methods, rheology is in fact merely a methodical way of quantifying what you see and feel when you handle a product. Neil’s Messy Play session replaces the maths with a fun hands-on practical experience where participants will get to poke, wobble and spread a range of everyday products and learn how to recognise those behaviours that we take for granted but never explicitly acknowledge. He will then introduce the key rheological concepts and properties that describe those behaviours and will go on to relate those properties specifically to cosmetic and

    1.30-1.45pm coffee break

    1.45-3.15pm Interactive presentations on formulation and ingredients/textures led by:

    TABLE 1: Adeline Coulson Croda How the old can become the new A showcase of some of Croda’s innovative textures using ingredients in different combinations to create a variety of systems for various applications. Information on the formulations and the key ingredients used will be provided.

    TABLE 2: Helen Hill Azelis From Champagne to Ice Cubes – How to create a world of texture from one formulation During this session, Azelis will present a range of seven different textures created using the same base formulation.

    TABLE 3: Andrea Tomlinson BASF Using emulsion technology to offer new textures During the session a range of novel textures will be presented where traditional emulsion technology has been modified to bring new textures and application effects.

    Each of these three interactive sessions will last 30 minutes and will repeat three times with delegates moving around to each of the three tables.

    3.30pm Round-up of the day

This year we are introducing a workshop series to develop and disseminate the ideas underpinning Terra Two, and we invite you to get involved with one or more! Workshops will be facilitated by one or more members of the Terra Two editorial team, and refreshments will be provided. This summer the Terra Two team will produce a printed catalogue which participants will have the opportunity to contribute to. \n Sign up to join us!\n\n\nWorkshop Five: Science Fictional Favourites \nFor this event, participants are invited to come and give a five minute presentation in any format on any favourite SF text in order to persuade others to read/view/play or listen to it. Participants need to send the title, author/director and publication date to l.king@yorksj.ac.uk a week in advance, as well as a PowerPoint slide or handout (if these will be used). Ideally the presentations will not only inspire enjoyable watching, reading and playing, but will feed into creative and critical ideas that can be developed for the August submission deadline for Terra Two. Following the presentations we will complete some writing tasks to that end. Participants will receive a list of ‘science fictional favourites’ to take away. \n"

On RSVP please could we ask you to make us aware of any food allergies prior to your attendance.</p> <p>The venue is in the Fountains learning Centre on the first floor.
