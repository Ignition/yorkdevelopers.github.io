- name: It's agileYork's 1st birthday! + Change the Language, Change the Rules
  description: "<p>Join us for a celebration of agileYork's 1st birthday! (There will be cake ;)</p> <p>12 months have passed and we've discovered so much along the way. Join us to learn just how a meetup called agileYork was formed using Agile! A number of past attendees have asked how they could start a meetup group and this evening will describe just that.</p> <p>From a very simple idea you'll discover how we as a group tested assumptions, experimented with formats and collectively built a meetup through feedback.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:30pm: welcome &amp; arrival<br/>6:45 pm: eat, drink, chat &amp; celebrate<br/>7.00pm: Creating an Agile meetup using Agile<br/>8.00pm: Change the Language, Change the Rules<br/>9:00pm: to the bar/pub?</p> <p>Change the Language, Change the Rules</p> <p>The language we use influences the way we see the world, how we work<br/>together and what we believe is possible. Want to find out how the<br/>structure of language, neuroscience and a bit of pseudoscience can<br/>help build a high-performing agile team? Then drop by for a case study<br/>on how to use Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) in agile teams, with<br/>real world examples, hints, tips and tricks.</p> <p>About Tom Hoyland</p> <p>With a career spanning software engineering, business analysis and<br/>digital transformation, Tom coaches a wide range of teams, weaving<br/>together agile values, language and psychological safety to build high<br/>performing, sustainable teams.</p> <p>A host at Agile Sheffield and a regular speaker at<br/>agile and product meetups, Tom enjoys presenting case studies,<br/>research and insights into successful agile transformations, team<br/>working and their metrics.</p> <p>Oh did I mention there will be cake ;)</p> <p>*** We're a Scrum Alliance Endorsed Group! You can earn SEUs by attending our events. ***</p> "

We will have vegetarian food, if you have any other dietary requirements or questions please send us a message.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ The talks</p> <p>✩ Keeping it Real(time)<br/>Mike Lehan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m1ke\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/m1ke</a></p> <p>Modern web app interfaces can be dynamic with lots of data changing and flowing, but behind this there's often still a mass of AJAX requests &amp; timers, making our work pseudo-live at best.</p> <p>Web sockets allow us to create two way live data flow between server &amp; client; WebRTC lets us allow our clients to connect to one another directly. We'll see how PHP fits into this front end ecosystem and how to augment our applications with real time components.</p> <p>✩ From bare metal boxes to Amazon ECS, our journey to the cloud<br/>Mark Taylor</p> <p>My talk will tell the story of how DealTrak moved from over a decade of bare metal hosting to AWS with practically zero downtime, and the technologies we opted for. We now use Docker consistently across all our environments, and manage our infrastructure - including deployments and spinning up UAT instances via Ansible playbooks.</p> <p>_______________________________</p> <p>★ Timings</p> <p>18:30 – Turn up, have a drink, a snack, and a chat (food, soft drinks, beer, coffee)<br/>19:00 – Keeping it Real(time) - Mike Lehan<br/>19:30 – A little break<br/>19:30 – From bare metal boxes to Amazon ECS, our journey to the cloud - Mark Taylor<br/>20:10ish – Pop over to the pub for a chat and a drink</p> <p>★ Sponsors</p> <p>Our sponsors make this monthly event possible, so please take the time to check them out, and thank them for their support.</p> <p>• Bruntwood - Platform (<a href=\"https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/\" class=\"linkified\">https://bruntwood.co.uk/our-locations/leeds/platform/</a>) – Platform is a reinvention of a Leeds landmark offering workspace for businesses of all sizes, right at the heart of the city.

The world of JavaScript frameworks has grown bigger and more complex. However, as of today, we see a few major players like React, Angular and Vue.js cementing their place. All of these are powerful complex beasts with a steep learning curve. Committing to any of the frameworks creates a major dependency for your organisation and a requirement for a specialised workforce capable of efficiently using the framework of choice. In addition, going with one of these frameworks locks you in the Frameworks ecosystem making it difficult to take advantage of developments in other JavaScript ecosystems. As we know the world of web development is an ever-changing environment and committing to a certain technology without a backup plan can have serious implications in the future.</p> <p>Today I would like to explore with you one possible solution for how we can introduce a backup plan for "safeguarding" the future of our JavaScript code and potentially take advantage of developments across different JavaScript ecosystems. This potential Solution is to build Web Components using our chosen JavaScript framework. I will talk about some of the options we have today with the top 3 JS frameworks and show a quick demo of how this can be done with Angular 6."</p> <p>Please note the group is intended for people looking to expand their knowledge.
