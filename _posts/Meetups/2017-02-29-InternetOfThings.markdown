York Internet Of Things

Sunday 9th April is world Internet of Things day (IoT). And what better way to mark it in York than by arranging York's first Meetup for people interested in the Internet of Things. This event will be an opportunity for people who share a common interest in IoT to meet each other and explore what potential exists for future Meetups, events and activities. Everyone is welcome whether you're new to this subject or have been active in it for years. Location details etc to be announced soon.
