On Saturday 24th March 2018, YorkDevelopers were at the University of York to help out on a free one day programming course for children aged 10-12. 
This event was delivered by [The Travelling Code Camp][travelling-code-camp-link] in association with the 
[York Digital City][digitalyork-link] "Connecting Kids" #CodeYork initiative.

YorkDevelopers were consulted in reviewing the course material which covered the basics of coding. 
Over 20 children attended and as you can see the organisers were very pleased how successful the day went :-)
