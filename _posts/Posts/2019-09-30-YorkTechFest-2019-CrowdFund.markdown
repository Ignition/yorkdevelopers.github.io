The crowdfund campaign is now open for YorkTechFest 2019! [Donate here][yorktechfest2019-crowdfund]

YorkTechFest is a Tech Conference on Monday 28th October from 6pm at York Explore Library and Archive, Museum Street, York to showcase the tech non-profit communities from York.  We bring together over 10 tech communities on one evening showcasing a programme of speakers and interactive workshops.

We are aiming to make YorkTechFest 2018 event by making YorkTechFest 2019 free!

Lets enable the Tech Conference for the City of York together!
