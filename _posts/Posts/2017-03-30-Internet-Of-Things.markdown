York.Developers are thrilled to welcome the Internet of Things meetup group in York.

Sunday 9th April is world Internet of Things day (IoT). And what better way to mark it in York than by arranging York's first Meetup for people interested in the Internet of Things. This event will be an opportunity for people who share a common interest in IoT to meet each other and explore what potential exists for future Meetups, events and activities.
