York Developers are proud to support the launch of [dotNetYork][dotnet-york-twitter-link].  dotNetYork provide knowledge, information, experience and practice on topics surrounding the .NET ecosystem.  In our [first meetup][dotnet-york-first-meetup-link] we look to how Functions as a Service (FaaS) seem to be trending as the next big buzzword and we'll look at the advantages of using FaaS and how we can take advantage of Azure Functions to build our APIs.
