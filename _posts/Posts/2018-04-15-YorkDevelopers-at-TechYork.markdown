On Thursday 26th April 2018, YorkDevelopers will be speaking about "Forming Tech Communities" at the Science City York [TechYork][tech-york-april-link] event in York City Centre.

We will be talking about how York Developers support technical professionals to host events to share knowledge about Tech.  We provide the support to enable technical professionals to host events to form groups for like-minded people to share specialist knowledge.  In the ethos of our organisation, we now wish to share our experiences with the wider tech-business community, represented by [Science City York][science-city-york-link] at the [TechYork][tech-york-april-link] event.
