Over 30 AgileYorkers joined us for a celebration of agileYork's 1st birthday! We had a cake to celebrate our agile journey.

12 months have passed and we've discovered so much along the way. We delivered a retrospective to learn just how a meetup called agileYork was formed using Agile! 

From a very simple idea as a group tested assumptions, experimented with formats and collectively built a meetup through feedback.

See [the photos from the event][agile-york-next-event] on our meetup page!
