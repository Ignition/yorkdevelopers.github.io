##### These are my tips for running a meetup.

- Pick a subject that you are passionate about or an area which will assist you in your professional development at work.  You are about to commit to leading a group of like minded individuals - you do not have to share  motivation with your group but they must align and drive you to devote your time to them.
- People will see you as a leader - even if you do not see yourself as one.
- Be prepared to be the centre of group comms, negative or positive.
- Encourage shared ownership of content from the offset.  Give and you will receive is very much the theme here.

##### Arranging the meetup

- Use venues that other groups use.  They have done the hard work for you in finding the best places to meet in your area.
- Avoid moving dates of the meetup.   This is not popular and you will lose about 50% of attendance - just because people have full diaries.
- Use meetup.com.  Really, I would.  I am not on commission but it really does provide the group organiser with the tools you need and people know how to engage with it. It's the place to be.

##### On the day:

- Turn up 15 minutes early to the meetup.  You will need to be there to get and someone will get there early.  You know who you are.
- At the end of each meetup, announce the date and venue of the next, even if you have not arranged speakers.  Diaries first, motivation to attend second.  Your cohort will appreciate that.
