##### These are my tips for setting up a meetup
**Pick a subject that you are passionate about** or an area which will assist you in your professional development.  You are about to commit to leading a group of like minded individuals - you do not have to share motivation with your group but your motivation must drive you to devote your time to them.

**Use venues that other groups use**.  They have done the hard work for you in finding the best places to meet in your area.

**Avoid changing the date of the meetup**. This is not popular and you will lose about 50% of attendance, just because people have full diaries.

**Use meetup.com or FaceBook groups**.  These tools provide the group organiser with the tools you need and people know how to engage with it.


##### On the day

**Turn up 15 minutes early to the meetup**.  You will need to be there to get set up and I guarantee someone will get there earlier than you.

At the end of each meetup, **announce the date and venue of the next one**, even if you have not arranged speakers.  Diaries first, motivation to attend second.  Your group will appreciate that.


##### Advice for the meetup organiser

Be prepared to **be the centre of group comms**, negative or positive.

**People will see you as a leader** - even if you do not see yourself as one.

**Encourage shared ownership of content** from the offset.  Give and you will receive is very much the theme here.
